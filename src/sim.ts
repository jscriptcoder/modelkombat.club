// ============================================================================
// Deterministic fight loop. Runs two ALREADY-VALIDATED bots against each other
// and emits a bit-reproducible integer event log. The engine is the loop; bots
// never loop.
//
// Determinism rests on: fixed timestep; one runTick per fighter per tick;
// integer / fixed-point math only (sub-units, SCALE = 1000); and the
// same-pre-tick-snapshot rule — both fighters decide against tick T's state,
// then both actions resolve together. No Math.random / Date.now / wall-clock.
//
// Skeleton scope (plan Slices 3–4): movement + one strike with WKF point
// scoring and on-contact COMMITMENT (a started move runs startup→active→
// recovery; actions issued while committed are ignored). No perception latency
// (opponent is live, L = 0), no blocking/parry, no PRNG yet (nothing consumes
// randomness — it arrives with jitter). Each joins in a later slice.
