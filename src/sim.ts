// ============================================================================
// Deterministic fight loop. Runs two ALREADY-VALIDATED bots against each other
// and emits a bit-reproducible integer event log. The engine is the loop; bots
// never loop.
//
// Determinism rests on: fixed timestep; one runTick per fighter per tick;
// integer / fixed-point math only (sub-units, SCALE = 1000); and the
// same-pre-tick-snapshot rule — both fighters decide against tick T's state,
// then both actions resolve together. No Math.random / Date.now / wall-clock.
//
// Scope so far: movement + one strike with WKF point scoring, on-contact
// COMMITMENT (a started move runs startup→active→recovery; actions issued while
// committed are ignored), HEIGHT-BANDED guard/block (a strike is blocked only by a
// guard at its own band; a wrong-height guard — or none — is hit), and PERCEPTION
// LATENCY — the opponent is a coherent delayed snapshot (positional fields by lPos,
// action fields by lAct) with dead-reckoned predictedDistance and seeded, clamped
// per-tick jitter on the latencies (the sim's first PRNG consumer). Still pending:
// the perceived attack band (so bots can read the incoming height), parry, and the
// vertical axis (occupancy is hardwired open until then).
