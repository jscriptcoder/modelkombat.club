// ============================================================================
// Deterministic fight loop. Runs two ALREADY-VALIDATED bots against each other
// and emits a bit-reproducible integer event log. The engine is the loop; bots
// never loop.
//
// Determinism rests on: fixed timestep; one runTick per fighter per tick;
// integer / fixed-point math only (sub-units, SCALE = 1000); and the
// same-pre-tick-snapshot rule — both fighters decide against tick T's state,
// then both actions resolve together. No Math.random / Date.now / wall-clock.
//
// Scope so far: movement + one strike with WKF point scoring, on-contact
// COMMITMENT (a started move runs startup→active→recovery; actions issued while
// committed are ignored), HEIGHT-BANDED guard/block (a strike is blocked only by a
// guard at its own band; a wrong-height guard — or none — is hit), and PERCEPTION
// LATENCY — the opponent is a coherent delayed snapshot (positional fields — x, y —
// by lPos, action fields — attacking, attackBand, posture — by lAct) with
// dead-reckoned predictedDistance and seeded, clamped per-tick jitter on the
// latencies (the sim's first PRNG consumer). A bot reads the incoming attack's
// height (attackBand) and the opponent's stance (posture) on the action layer, and
// the opponent's height (y) on the positional layer. VERTICAL AXIS: a `crouch`
// vacates the `high` band, and an airborne fighter (jump arc, committed: canAct=0
// until it lands at y=0) vacates `low` once past `lowClearance` — so a high strike
// whiffs a croucher and a sweep whiffs a jumper (the §11.3 step-3 occupancy gate,
// no longer hardwired open). The arc is fixed-point (y += vy; vy -= gravity). PARRY:
// the opening `parryWindow` ticks of a matching-band guard DEFLECT an absorbed strike
// (no score) and throw the attacker into `parryRecovery` extra recovery, where a guard
// held past the window only blocks; a parry also opens a COUNTER WINDOW — a strike the
// parrying fighter lands within `counterWindow` ticks scores an extra `counterBonus`.
// Strikes resolve via the §11 compute-then-apply union (both outcomes computed from the
// frozen snapshot, then applied) so the counter's cross-fighter effect stays
// swap-symmetric. THROW: a committed grab (startup → grab-active → recovery) GRABS a
// grounded defender in reach — beating any guard/parry (it is unbanded) — scoring and
// knocking them DOWN (canAct=0, untargetable) for knockdownDuration ticks. The §11.4
// precedence strike > throw is resolved in the same union: a fighter is open while
// throwing, so an opposing active in-range strike (a HIT) STUFFS the throw — the grab is
// voided and the throw marked resolved (it cannot grab on a later frame), but the thrower
// stays committed through its recovery (punishable). A defender's THROW-BREAK on a grab-active
// tick defeats the grab the same way (throw-break > throw); a break is a per-tick action (no
// commitment) and NOT a guard, so a strike still hits it. Still pending: perceiving the counter
// window (self.counterWindow) and the incoming throw (opponent.throwing); throw clash.
