// ============================================================================
// Benchmark aggregator — the pure scoring core of the one-shot LLM bot-authoring
// benchmark. Given a submitted bot, a frozen gauntlet, the seed set, a tick cap,
// the frame table, and (in WKF match mode) the win gap, it runs every
// (opponent × seed × side) fight through the real deterministic engine
// (`runFight`) and reduces them to the ranking figures — win-rate (primary) and
// Σ net-points (tiebreaker) — with a per-opponent breakdown.
//
// PURE + deterministic: no I/O, no clock, no randomness of its own — the only
// entropy is each fight's seed, which threads `runFight`'s PRNG. Each
// (opponent × seed) is played TWICE — submitted bot as fighter A, then as
// fighter B — and both fights count, cancelling the start-side / PRNG-draw-order
// asymmetry baked into the perception jitter (a matchup is not side-symmetric).
//
// No mirror: a gauntlet opponent that deep-equals the submitted document is
// skipped (a bot vs its own clone is just side-asymmetry noise). For a real LLM
// submission this never triggers; it only matters when self-testing a roster bot.
