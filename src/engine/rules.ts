// ============================================================================
// The CANONICAL frame table — the authoritative `Rules` the platform fights on.
// Engine-level single source of truth (the runner, and the future API / viewer,
// all consume this); it supersedes the provisional `src/cli/demo-rules.ts`.
//
// Every number here is PROVEN by a behavioral `runFight` test in `rules.test.ts`:
// the suite asserts the design relationships (the master inequalities + WKF
// scoring), not the literals in isolation — so the table is "balanced" in the
// structural sense (it satisfies the deep-karate read game), not the
// telemetry-tuned sense (that needs a mass-matchup harness — a later capability).
//
// Built additively, one capability slice at a time (mirroring the engine's C1–C8):
//   • Slice 2 (here): the strike read-game core — movement, the one strike, and the
//     reaction-viable perception layer. `lAct` and `strike.reach` are LOCKED here;
//     later slices respect them (every committed startup ≥ lAct+1; the reach
//     hierarchy throw < sweep < strike is filled in additively).
//   • Slices 3–5 (later): strike defenses (parry/counter/cancel windows), the throw
//     triangle, and the sweep + okizeme + air physics — each adds optional fields.
//
// Units: integer sub-units, SCALE = 1000 sub-units / world unit. The ring is 600
// units wide; fighters start 300 units apart; a strike reaches 240 units (so the
// pair starts OUT of range and must close ~60 units to threaten).

  //     an extra yuko (≈ waza-ari, 2 total). 10 ≥ startup(7)+2, so a startup-7 counter lands in time.

  //   • active 2 — a 2-tick grab window (forgiving enough to catch a step-in); the FIRST
  //     active frame still governs the break edge, so it does not soften the read.
  //   • recovery 14 ≥ lAct (6) + strike.startup (7) ⇒ a whiffed (or stuffed) grab is

  //     bigger commitment.

  //     throw < sweep < strike; the sweep fills the gap in a later slice).

  //     a frame to spare, while an UN-cancelled strike (neutral tick 22, active 29) arrives far too
  //     late ⇒ the hit-confirm cancel is load-bearing.

  // clamped to `max`. The numbers:

  //     (regen 10 < strike cost 20), so a free spammer floors the meter (5 strikes empty it
  //     to exactly 0) and the next commit degrades to idle, while a fighter that paces
  //     between strikes lets regen refill the cost and never runs dry. Pacing — not the meter
  //     alone — is what sustains offense.

  //     (a later slice) sits inside (specialCost > gasThreshold ≥ basicCost): a gassed fighter
