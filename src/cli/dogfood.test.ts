// The dogfood bot — authored COLD from `docs/spec.md` alone (the one-shot

// prove the generated spec is a sufficient authoring instrument. Two things are
// pinned here: (1) it VALIDATES first-try, and (2) run through the real v4
// benchmark (WKF match mode + senshu, CANONICAL_RULES with the Slice-6 de-wall
// kd=18) it competes as a REAL match participant — winning some matchups and
// losing most. This replaces the stale raw-600-tick read (a −2682 "> half
// net-points" near-miss against a 100%-win sweeper); under match mode the sweeper
// is 69% and the score ranks by match wins, so the dogfood is a
// weak-but-legitimate entry.
