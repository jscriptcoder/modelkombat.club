// The dogfood bot — authored COLD from `docs/spec.md` alone (the one-shot
// benchmark input), exercising the spec's sweep→cancel→finish okizeme combo to
// prove the generated spec is a sufficient authoring instrument. Two things are
// pinned here: (1) it VALIDATES first-try, and (2) run through the real v12
// benchmark (WKF match mode + senshu, CANONICAL_RULES) it competes as a REAL
// match participant — winning some matchups and losing most. This replaces the
// stale raw-600-tick read (a −2682 "> half net-points" near-miss against a
// 100%-win sweeper); under match mode the score ranks by match wins, so the
// dogfood is a weak-but-legitimate entry. Gauntlet modernization S1 (vulture
// gains a parry→counter) shifted its record 16W/104L → 18W/102L; S-jabber
// (jabber gains block+counter) left it unchanged — the dogfood was already
// losing its jabber matchup, so re-arming jabber did not move its total.
