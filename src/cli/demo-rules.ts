// ============================================================================
// PROVISIONAL demo frame table for the CLI fight runner — NOT the canonical
// frame table. The real, balanced frame table is a future TDD capability (see
// `docs/DESIGN.md` and CLAUDE.md "NEXT"); these numbers exist only to make the
// runner produce a legible, mechanically-rich demo fight. They mirror the shape
// of the test mocks. Tune freely — nothing in the engine depends on them.
//
// Units: integer sub-units, SCALE = 1000 sub-units / world unit. The ring is
// 600 units wide; fighters start 300 units apart; a strike reaches 220 units.
