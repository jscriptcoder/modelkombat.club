# §7 match-structure remainder — story split

Source design: `docs/DESIGN.md` §7a (grill 2026-07-01). Precedent to mirror:
benchmark match-structure (PRs #87–#93) — additive slices, each byte-identical
when its `match` config key is absent + replay-stable, with downstream
benchmark-adoption + spec-teaching slices.

## Progress

- **A1 — jogai out-zone detection + reset — ✅ DONE** (PR #97, merged 2026-07-01;
  `main`@`30e0288`). Optional `FightConfig.match.jogai.margin` over the unchanged
  hard clamp; on-entry edge-detect (in→out) fires `resetToNeutral(both)`; `wasInBounds`
  trackers re-armed post-reset (+ robust B1 init from start position); yame pre-empts
  jogai same-tick, a prior score stands. Byte-identical absent `match.jogai`, replay-stable,
  swap-symmetric. NO penalty/points/perception yet. Single-slice plan file deleted (record
  in git/PR #97).
- **A2 — jogai warning-ladder penalty — ✅ DONE** (PR #98, merged 2026-07-02;
  `main`@`e9d0771`). Per-fighter `penaltyCount` (bout-persistent, generic — passivity B2
  shares it); 1st foul free, 2+ ⇒ opponent +1 feeding `winGap`; ungated winGap re-check →
  `endReason "gap"`. Byte-identical absent `match.jogai`, replay-stable, swap-symmetric; no
  DSL/TCB surface. 770 tests; scoped `sim.ts` mutation 97.62% (changed-line 100%, lone
  survivor equivalent). Single-slice plan file (`jogai-warning-ladder.md`) deleted (record in
  git/PR #98). The A2 resolved-decisions section below is retained as the design record.
- **A3 — jogai penalty perception — ✅ DONE** (PR #99, merged 2026-07-02;
  `main`@`e8cc71c`). Two static live-scoreboard `FIELD_READERS` — `self.penalties`
  (own bout foul count) + `opponent.penalties` (the foe's), both zero-delay off the live
  fighter (like `opponent.points`, NOT the `L_act` ring buffer); `SelfState`/`OpponentState`
  gain `penalties`, the delayed `viewFor`/perceive types widened to `Omit<…, "points" |
"penalties">`. Byte-identical absent `match.jogai` (sentinel `0`), live zero-delay,
  interpreter stays 100% (static entries, no new branch). 776 tests; fresh scoped mutation
  17/17 = 100% (`sim.ts:277-279` 1/1, `dsl.ts:111-126` 16/16). `docs/spec.md` regenerated
  (2 fields join the read-surface list + JSON-schema enum; drift test green); penalty _prose_
  teaching deferred to D2. Single-slice plan file (`penalty-perception.md`) deleted (record in
  git/PR #99). **Capability A (jogai) is COMPLETE** (A1+A2+A3, PRs #97–#99).
- **B1 — passivity clock + reset-on-contact + re-engage reset — ✅ DONE** (PR #100,
  merged 2026-07-02; `main`@`66f6307`). Optional `FightConfig.match.passivity.limit` +
  per-fighter `Fighter.ticksSinceOffense` (always present, init 0). Attacker-only reset
  predicate `aOutcome !== null || aThrow !== null` (D1); increments every tick (D2);
  stuffed/clash grabs still reset — reads `aThrow` not `aThrowFinal` (D3); fires on strict
  `> limit` (D4); any re-engage (yame/jogai/passivity) zeros both clocks via `resetToNeutral`
  (D5, gated on `match?.passivity`). Byte-identical absent `match.passivity` (field never
  framed), replay-stable, swap-symmetric; **no DSL/TCB surface** (perception is B3/B4), no new
  `endReason` (penalty is B2). 784 tests; scoped `sim.ts` mutation 14/14 = 100% (a T3-mirror
  sole-fouler test killed the last `> limit` survivor). Single-slice plan file
  (`passivity-clock.md`) deleted (record in git/PR #100). The B1 resolved-decisions section
  below is retained as the design record.
- **B2 — passivity feeds the shared penalty ladder — ✅ DONE** (PR #101, merged 2026-07-02;
  `main`@`6e43bec`). B1's inert passivity re-engage becomes a real penalty on the **shared**
  `Fighter.penaltyCount` (A2's ladder): each fighter whose OWN clock `> limit` fouls — 1st free,
  2+ ⇒ opponent +1 (D1, per-fighter mutual net-zero; both-idle ⇒ mutual +1); fires independent of
  a same-tick score (D2 — only yame's both-neutral reset pre-empts, via B1's D5 clock-zeroing);
  same `winGap` re-check → `endReason "gap"` before the reset (D4, at most one check/tick). A2's
  inline award graduated to a shared `applyPenalty(fouler, opponent)` called from BOTH the jogai
  and passivity blocks (D3, pure REFACTOR-step extraction — jogai byte-identical). The headline
  cross-mechanic behavior: a warning spent on jogai makes the FIRST passivity foul cost (shared
  counter). Byte-identical absent `match.passivity`, replay-stable, swap-symmetric; **no DSL/TCB
  surface** (perception is B3/B4), no new `endReason`. 791 tests; scoped `sim.ts` mutation 100%
  (passivity block + `applyPenalty` helper 29/29, jogai call site 4/4). Single-slice plan file
  (`passivity-penalty.md`) deleted (record in git/PR #101). The B2 resolved-decisions section below
  is retained as the design record.
- **B3 — self passivity clock read (live) — ✅ DONE** (PR #102, merged 2026-07-02;
  `main`@`50e5d44`). Capability B's FIRST new DSL surface: the live self-perception field
  **`self.passivityRemaining`** — a derived countdown `Math.max(0, limit − ticksSinceOffense)`
  in `viewFor` (D1), sentinel `0` unconfigured (D2), `0` = "connect this tick or foul"; restarts on
  any re-engage/connect (mirrors the `finishWindow`/`counterWindow`/`cancelWindow` "ticks-left"
  precedent). One `FieldPath` member + one `SelfState.passivityRemaining` field + one **static**
  `FIELD_READERS` entry + `match` threaded into `viewFor` — no new interpreter branch ⇒ `dsl.ts`
  interpreter stays 100% (only the value is config-gated). Also **completed B1's `aThrow` throw-reset
  verification** (D3/AC-3): a plain grab-active tick AND a stuffed grab (reads `aThrow`, not the
  voided `aThrowFinal`) both snap the clock back — the term B1 couldn't observe. Byte-identical absent
  `match.passivity` (field never framed, sentinel `0`), replay-stable, swap-symmetric. 800 tests;
  scoped mutation 100% (`sim.ts` derivation 3/3, `dsl.ts` reader 1/1, wiring 0 mutable nodes — zero
  survivors/equivalents). `docs/spec.md` regenerated (field joins the read-surface list + JSON-schema
  enum; drift test green); strategic prose deferred to Capability D (D4). Single-slice plan file
  (`passivity-self-read.md`) deleted (record in git/PR #102). The B3 resolved-decisions section below
  is retained as the design record.
- **B4 — opponent passivity clock read (delayed) — ✅ DONE** (PR #103, merged 2026-07-02;
  `main`@`71e19fc`). **Capability B (passivity) is now COMPLETE** (B1–B4, PRs #100–#103). The
  opponent-perception field **`opponent.passivityRemaining`** on the **`L_act`-delayed** ring-buffer
  layer (like `opponent.stamina`) — a bot perceives how close the FOE is to a passivity foul and can
  bait the forced commit. **DELAYED, not live** (D1): rides `oppAct`, complementing A3's live
  `opponent.penalties` (pending timer delayed, landed foul live). `frameOf` records raw
  `ticksSinceOffense` (scoring-agnostic, like `stamina`); `perceiveOpponent` derives `Math.max(0,
limit − oppAct.ticksSinceOffense)`, threading `match` in (D2, the C10 S4b `isGassedAt` precedent) —
  coherent with B3's self read at `L_act = 0` (D3). REFACTOR: shared `passivityRemainingOf(tso, match)`
  now feeds BOTH the B3 live self read (`viewFor`) and this delayed opponent read (`perceiveOpponent`).
  One `FieldPath` member + `OpponentState.passivityRemaining` + one **static** `FIELD_READERS` entry ⇒
  `dsl.ts` interpreter stays 100% (D4). Byte-identical absent `match.passivity` (the new
  `Frame.ticksSinceOffense` frames `0`, never enters `FightResult`; served value sentinel `0`),
  replay-stable, swap-symmetric. 809 tests; scoped mutation 100% (shared `passivityRemainingOf` helper
  4/4, `dsl.ts` reader 1/1, `frameOf` copy 0 mutable nodes — zero survivors/equivalents). `docs/spec.md`
  regenerated (field joins read-surface list + JSON-schema enum; drift test green); strategic prose
  deferred to Capability D. Single-slice plan file (`passivity-opponent-read.md`) deleted (record in
  git/PR #103). The B4 resolved-decisions section below is retained as the design record.
- **C1 — senshu first-blood tiebreak — ✅ DONE** (PRs #104–#105, merged 2026-07-02;
  `main`@`170a9e1`). **Capability C's first story COMPLETE** — a LEVEL bout at the cap is won by the
  first fighter to score a **technique**, behind `FightConfig.match.senshu?: boolean` (scoring-layer,
  NOT `Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES` ⇒ `npm run fight` unaffected). Two additive slices: **C1a** (#104) the
  latch — a bout-level `senshuHolder: "undecided"|"A"|"B"|"none"` `runFight` local (survives every
  yame/jogai/passivity reset; no new per-fighter field) decided the first tick a fighter's TECHNIQUE
  points rise, read **pre-penalty** so a penalty point never confers; a solo first-scorer holds it, a
  simultaneous first ⇒ `none` (permanent); the terminal tally rewrites a `"draw"` → the holder with the
  new `endReason "senshu"` (only when level; a points/gap winner is untouched). **C1b** (#105) the
  WKF **revocation** — a holder that commits its OWN jogai/passivity foul (incl. the free 1st warning)
  loses senshu → `none` (not transferred); a non-holder's foul leaves it intact; four guarded lines in
  the existing penalty blocks, after `applyPenalty`, so the combat-phase latch precedes the
  penalty-phase revoke (⇒ a same-tick score+foul latches then revokes). **No DSL/TCB surface** (`self`/
  `opponent.senshu` is C3 — `dsl.ts` untouched); **no `docs/spec.md` change** (prose to Capability D).
  Byte-identical absent `match.senshu` (and when jogai/passivity configured but no foul occurs),
  replay-stable, swap-symmetric. 832 tests; scoped `sim.ts` mutation: C1a latch+terminal 39/40, C1b
  revocation 24/28 — the survivors are all the equivalent `"none"→""` StringLiteral (`senshuHolder` is
  only ever read via `=== "undecided"/"A"/"B"`, so `""` is indistinguishable). Every dangerous mutant
  killed (always-revoke, drop-holder-check, wrong-fighter, `&&`→`||`, statement-removal). The C1 plan
  (`senshu-tiebreak.md`) deleted (record in git/PRs #104–#105). The C1 resolved-decisions section below
  is retained as the design record.
- **C2 — sudden-death overtime — ✅ DONE** (PRs #107–#108, merged 2026-07-02; `main`@`8ca63ea`).
  **Capability C's second story COMPLETE** — a LEVEL bout at the cap plays one fixed sudden-death period
  (first to a 1-point gap), behind `FightConfig.match.overtime?: { ticks }` (scoring-layer, NOT
  `Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES` ⇒ `npm run fight` unaffected); absent or `ticks ≤ 0` ⇒ byte-identical. Model X
  (**OT-first**): overtime is tried before C1's terminal senshu override, reused untouched as the
  exhaust-still-level fallback. Two additive slices: **C2a** (#107, officiating) — the `runFight` loop cap
  goes dynamic: at the end of the last regulation tick, if LEVEL (`a.points === b.points`) and a period is
  configured, `cap` extends to `maxTicks + ticks`, `inOT` flips, both bodies `resetToNeutral` (points /
  stamina / penaltyCount / mem / senshuHolder persist); the winGap threshold drops to `1` at the three
  EXISTING check-sites (`gap = inOT ? 1 : winGap` at yame/jogai/passivity) ⇒ first to a 1-point gap (a
  technique OR a 2nd+ penalty — penalties fully live in OT) wins `endReason "overtime"`, a same-tick trade
  stays level, OT exhausting level falls to senshu/draw (a holder's OT foul still forfeits senshu); the
  OT-entry block runs AFTER the officiating blocks (a same-tick gap-stop pre-empts it); `FightResult.ticks`
  counts OT. No DSL surface. 848 tests; scoped `sim.ts` mutation 92.31% — 4 documented equivalents (the
  `otTicks ≤ 0` OT-entry guards fire an unobserved last-tick reset; the `scored = false` reset is a harmless
  same-tick spurious yame). **C2b** (#108, perception — folds in C4) — **`clock.overtime`** (new
  `ClockState` view field, `inOT ? 1 : 0`) via a new static `clock.overtime` FIELD_READER (the only new TCB
  surface; value config-gated ⇒ `dsl.ts` interpreter stays 100%), and **`clock.ticksRemaining`** now counts
  the current period's budget (`cap − tick` — K on the first OT tick, 1 on the last, never negative);
  `docs/spec.md` regenerated (one bullet + one JSON Schema enum entry, auto-derived from `ALLOWED_FIELDS`;
  no OT prose — Capability D). 853 tests; scoped Stryker 100% on the changed `sim.ts` clock line + `dsl.ts`
  reader (both `inOT ? 1 : 0` arms hand-verified — Stryker emits no `ConditionalExpression` mutant for
  `X ? 1 : 0` literal ternaries). Byte-identical absent `match.overtime`, replay-stable, swap-symmetric.
  The C2 plan (`c2-overtime.md`) deleted (record in git/PRs #107–#108). The C2 resolved-decisions section
  below is retained as the design record.
- **C3 — senshu perception — ✅ DONE** (PR #110, merged 2026-07-03; `main`@`a9d9a38`). **Capability C
  COMPLETE** — two **live, egocentric** DSL reads off the bout-level `senshuHolder`: **`self.senshu`** (1 iff
  I hold senshu) + **`opponent.senshu`** (1 iff the foe holds it), `? 1 : 0`, with `undecided`/`none`
  collapsing to `0/0` (the "still-winnable" availability tell deferred as YAGNI). LIVE scoreboard layer in
  `viewFor` (zero delay, like `opponent.points`) — NOT the `L_act` ring buffer (`senshuHolder` isn't framed;
  a delayed tell would contradict the live points it's derived from). **Single slice**: `senshuHolder`
  threaded into `viewFor`, each call site computing `senshuHolder === "A"/"B" ? 1 : 0` (the `===` at the call
  site ⇒ mutation-covered; the comparison form DOES generate `ConditionalExpression` mutants, unlike C2b's
  bare `inOT ? 1 : 0` ternary — killed both-arms by swap + undecided fixtures). Two static `FIELD_READERS`
  (`SelfState.senshu`/`OpponentState.senshu`, the only new TCB surface; value config-gated ⇒ `dsl.ts`
  interpreter stays 100%); mechanical `gen:spec` regen (2 bullets + 2 JSON Schema enum entries, no prose; no
  `BENCHMARK_VERSION`/`INPUT_HASH` change). 867 tests; scoped Stryker 100% (18/18: `dsl.ts` 2/2, `sim.ts`
  16/16). AC-1…AC-11; **AC-6** (same-tick latch-then-revoke never flashes) + **AC-9** (persistence across the
  OT `resetToNeutral`) covered transitively (AC-1/AC-3 + the already-tested C1 latch / C2 persistence, C3 read
  at 100% mutation). Byte-identical absent `match.senshu` (`0/0`; existing bots don't read the fields),
  replay-stable, swap-symmetric. The C3 plan (`c3-senshu-perception.md`) deleted (record in git/PR #110). The
  C3 resolved-decisions section below is retained as the design record.
- **Capability D — benchmark + spec senshu adoption — ✅ DONE** (PRs #113–#114, merged 2026-07-03;
  `main`@`0b8c3f1`). **Capability D COMPLETE** — the downstream adoption of the built §7 senshu tie-break
  (C1/C3) into the LLM benchmark + `docs/spec.md`; NO engine change (senshu shipped in C1/C3). **Scoped to
  senshu only** (jogai/passivity/overtime adoption + prose DEFERRED — they'd force a gauntlet rebalance /
  mislead authors with fields reading `0`). **D1 (#113)**: widen `BenchmarkConfig["match"]` → shared
  `FightConfig["match"]` (senshu carried typed; aggregator keys off the resulting `winner` ⇒ no logic change);
  `MATCH = { winGap: 8, senshu: true }`; `BENCHMARK_VERSION v3→v4`; `INPUT_HASH` re-pinned; synthetic
  SCORER/DELAYED solo-first-blood test (win under senshu / draw without, both sides, net-invariant); dogfood
  re-pinned `15W/104L/1D → 16W/104L/0D`; added `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v4.md` (report-only: senshu sharpens
  the ranking, 0 draws; `sweeper` 69→82% out-HIGH [new], `vulture` 16% out-low → 4/6 in band; both DEFERRED).
  **D2 (#114, version-neutral)**: `generateSpec` `Match` gains `senshu?`; win-condition prose teaches the
  `winGap → senshu → residual-draw` cascade + primer names `self.senshu`/`opponent.senshu`, both **gated on
  `match.senshu`** (taught == scored); `docs/spec.md` regenerated (2 prose regions). No new DSL/TCB surface
  (senshu reads shipped in C3); `npm run fight` unaffected. 872 tests; D1 mutation 100% (65/65), D2 100%
  (6/6). The plan (`d-benchmark-spec-adoption.md`) deleted (record in git / PRs #113–#114 + gauntlet-v4 doc).

## Parent

**Actor:** the match officiating layer that scores an LLM-authored bot (and,
downstream, the frozen benchmark that ranks it).
**Capability:** complete WKF match officiating beyond yame + `winGap` — penalize
**retreat** (jogai), penalize **non-engagement** (passivity), and **decisively
resolve level bouts** (senshu + overtime).
**Outcome:** match outcomes reward genuine WKF engagement — no cornering-to-safety,
no far-apart stalling, no unresolved draws — so the benchmark measures real
fighting skill, not clock-farming.
**Current constraint:** three distinct mechanics, each with its own state,
perception surface, and downstream benchmark/spec adoption — far too large for one
PR. Every slice must stay byte-identical when its `match` key is absent
(`Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES`/`npm run fight` untouched) and hold the invariants
(determinism, integer-only outcome math, DSL-as-data TCB, same pre-tick snapshot).

Each child story is a thin end-to-end capability: a rule that changes an
observable fight outcome, demonstrable by a `runFight` test, byte-identical absent
its config key.

## Recommended First Slice

**A1 — a fighter that retreats into the out-zone triggers a yame reset back to
center** (boundary geometry + on-entry edge-detect + reset; no penalty yet).

Why this first: it burns the single biggest _architecture risk_ of the whole
feature — reading a new officiating boundary (`[margin, width−margin]`) over the
existing hard positional clamp and firing the reset path — as a clean tracer,
independent of the penalty ladder. End-to-end and demonstrable; every later jogai
and passivity slice builds on this reset/edge-detect spine.

## Split Candidates

### Capability A — Jogai (ring-out penalty)

| Slice                             | Value                                                     | Includes                                                                                                                                                                                               | Defers                                | Acceptance Examples                                                                                                                                           | Release                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **A1** out-zone detection + reset | Proves the boundary read + reset spine; de-risks geometry | `match.jogai.margin`; legal `[margin, width−margin]`; on-entry edge-detect (in-bounds→out); `resetToNeutral` both; `was-in-bounds` tracker set true post-reset                                         | Penalty, points, warnings, perception | Given `margin` set, When A walks past `margin`, Then both reset to start that tick (points unchanged). Given absent `match.jogai`, Then byte-identical replay | Shippable (inert without config) |
| **A2** warning-ladder penalty     | The jogai _value_: retreat costs points                   | Shared per-fighter `penaltyCount` (generic, reused by passivity); 1st foul free, 2+ ⇒ opponent +1 → existing `winGap`; `winGap` re-check at the jogai boundary (endReason `"gap"`); jogai `FightEvent` | Perception fields                     | Given A's 1st out-zone entry, Then warning only (0 pts). Given A's 2nd, Then B +1 pt + reset. Given enough retreats, Then B wins on `winGap`                  | Shippable                        |
| **A3** penalty perception         | Bots can read the shared warning count                    | `self.penalties` + `opponent.penalties` (live scoreboard `FIELD_READERS`, like `opponent.points`); interpreter stays 100%                                                                              | Passivity/senshu reads                | Given A has 1 warning, Then A's bot reads `self.penalties==1` and B reads `opponent.penalties==1`                                                             | Shippable                        |

### Capability B — Passivity (non-engagement penalty) — reuses A2's ladder

| Slice                                             | Value                                          | Includes                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Defers              | Acceptance Examples                                                                                                                                                                  | Release                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **B1** clock + reset-on-contact + re-engage reset | Proves the anti-stall metric (the subtle part) | Per-fighter `ticksSinceOffense`; reset **only on contact** (hit/block/parry/grab/sweep-connect — whiff at air does NOT reset); exceed `match.passivity.limit` ⇒ `resetToNeutral` both + reset both clocks | Penalty, perception | Given two far-apart idle bots, When neither connects for `limit` ticks, Then both reset to `startGap`. Given a whiff-at-air spammer, Then it still goes passive (whiff didn't reset) | Shippable (inert without config) |

## Parking Lot

- **Bargain — C1 (senshu) could jump the queue.** It's a tiny latch that
  immediately fixes the benchmark's `"draw"` gap, fully independent of jogai/
  passivity. If a quick decisive-outcomes win is wanted before the (larger)
  spatial/anti-stall work, plan C1 first. (Default keeps the grill's jogai-first
  sequence, which tackles the distinctive spatial mechanic + the original
  stall motivation.)
- **A1/A2 may merge** into one penalty-bearing jogai PR if the team prefers not to
  ship a consequence-free reset intermediate. Kept split to de-risk geometry alone.
- **C4 may fold into C2** (expose `clock.overtime` where OT is introduced).
- **D1 may split per capability** (adopt+re-characterize after jogai, then
  passivity, then tie-res) rather than one consolidated adoption — safer if any
  single mechanic swings the gauntlet hard.
- **Possible gauntlet rebalance follow-up** (like the match-structure sweeper
  de-wall / the still-open `vulture` parry→counter story): jogai caps the zoner/
  turtle escape space and passivity taxes patient counter-play — the `zoner` and
  `vulture` archetypes will feel these most, so expect a re-tune candidate.
- **Ladder constants** (1 free warning, +1 pt/foul) are fixed for the first pass;
  parameterize under `match` only if tuning demands it.
- **`opponent.penalties`** in A3 is a live scoreboard read (zero-delay, like
  `opponent.points`) — confirm it should NOT ride the `L_act` layer (penalties are
  public scoreboard facts, so live is correct).

## Warnings

- Keep the officiating **per-tick order** explicit (design §7a): resolve combat →
  update clocks → `events.push` → apply all triggered penalties (commutative
  per-fighter) → **at most one** `resetToNeutral(both)` → one `winGap` check. A
  same-tick score's yame reset pre-empts jogai. This ordering is the swap-symmetry
  contract — every slice touching officiating needs a swap-symmetry test.
- These are **not** component slices — resist a "detect out-of-bounds" /
  "apply penalty" / "expose field" horizontal read across all three capabilities.
  Each row above is a whole observable rule change with a `runFight` acceptance test.
- Replay-stability + byte-identical-absent must be re-proven per slice (the
  precedent's discipline), plus mutation on the changed `sim.ts`/`dsl.ts`/
  `gen-spec.ts` regions.

## A2 — resolved decisions & acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-02)

Confirmed before planning A2 (jogai warning-ladder penalty). Feeds `planning` directly.

**Observability contract (decision):** penalties are observed **via `points` + reset only** — a
paid foul shows as the opponent's `points` / `scores` / `winner` / `endReason`; a free warning
shows as a `resetToNeutral` with **no** point delta. **No** new `FightEvent` / `FightResult` field
this slice (stays byte-identical; all penalty surfacing waits for A3's DSL reads). "jogai
`FightEvent`" in the table = the existing per-tick frame, not a new event type.

**Acceptance criteria (design-resolved, §7a):**

- **AC-1 — free first foul.** Given `match.jogai.margin` set and a fighter on its 1st out-zone
  crossing of the bout, When it crosses in→out, Then both reset to start, that fighter's
  `penaltyCount` = 1, and **neither** fighter's `points` change (warning only).
- **AC-2 — 2nd+ foul scores the opponent.** Given a fighter on its 2nd (or later) crossing, When it
  crosses out, Then its **opponent** gains +1 point and both reset. (The point appears in the
  **next** tick's frame — awarded after `events.push`, per A1's reset precedent.)
- **AC-3 — penalty can end the match.** Given enough retreats that a jogai +1 makes the gap reach
  `winGap`, Then the fight ends that tick, `endReason "gap"`, winner = the leading fighter. (winGap
  re-checked inside the jogai block after the award; mutually exclusive with the yame block's check
  ⇒ at most one per tick.)
- **AC-4 — per-fighter counters, bout-persistent.** Each fighter has its own `penaltyCount` (generic
  name — passivity B2 will share it); it persists across every yame/jogai reset (like `points`),
  never reset mid-bout.
- **AC-5 — both-out same tick.** Given both fighters cross out on the same tick, Then each fighter's
  OWN foul history decides whether ITS opponent scores (both past the free warning ⇒ mutual +1,
  net-zero gap; one still on its free warning ⇒ only the other opponent scores), with a **single**
  reset and no spurious early-stop. (Swap-symmetric.)
- **AC-6 — yame pre-empts jogai.** Given the rare both-neutral + scored + out tick, Then the yame
  block resets first (snapping the offender in-bounds), so jogai does **not** fire ⇒ **no** penalty
  awarded, single reset.
- **AC-7 — byte-identical absent config.** Given `match.jogai` absent, Then replay is byte-identical
  to pre-A2 (the new `penaltyCount` field is never touched and never enters a frame). Given
  `match.jogai` present, replay is stable and swap-symmetric.

**Implementation notes (not user-facing):** award inline in the jogai block; field named
`penaltyCount` (generic) but extract a shared award helper only when passivity (B2) arrives (YAGNI).
Ladder constants (1 free warning, +1 pt/foul) hardcoded — `margin` stays the only `jogai` config. A1
tests that cross ≥2 times and asserted "points unchanged" get updated (the 2nd crossing now scores).

## B1 — resolved decisions & acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-02)

Confirmed before planning B1 (passivity clock + reset-on-contact + re-engage reset). Feeds
`planning` directly. **B1 scope:** the anti-stall METRIC + re-engage reset ONLY — **NO penalty,
NO winGap, NO perception, NO new `endReason`** (penalty is B2, perception B3/B4). A passivity reset
is a pure re-engage, exactly like A1's jogai reset.

**Config:** `FightConfig.match.passivity?: { limit: number }` (ticks) — scoring-layer, NOT
`Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES` (`npm run fight` unaffected). `limit` is test-fixture-only until D.

**State:** per-fighter `Fighter.ticksSinceOffense` (integer, init `0`), **always present** (like
`penaltyCount`) so absent config ⇒ never touched ⇒ never framed ⇒ byte-identical. **NOT** reset by
`resetToNeutral` (it persists like `points`/`penaltyCount` by default; the re-engage zeroing is an
explicit officiating step, gated on passivity configured — see AC-7).

**Resolved decisions (grill/find-gaps):**

- **D1 — reset predicate: ATTACKER ONLY** (Q1). A fighter's clock resets iff _its own_ committed
  offense connected this tick: **`aOutcome !== null || aThrow !== null`** (strike hit/block/parry/
  finish, OR a live grab). The fighter merely hit/defended-against does NOT reset — "no-OFFENSE
  clock". A real back-and-forth resets both naturally (each attacks); a pure block-only turtle
  eventually goes passive.
- **D2 — increments EVERY tick, unconditionally** (Q2). No state gate — a committed/knocked-down
  fighter still accrues (bounded: knockdown ≤ `knockdownDuration` ≪ a sane `limit`).
- **D3 — stuffed/clash throw DOES reset** (Q3). Read **`aThrow`** (the pre-precedence `computeThrow`
  result, a `const` frozen before `stuffIfDefeated`), **NOT** `aThrowFinal` — so a grab that was
  live-but-voided (stuffed by a strike, or clashed) still resets the thrower. (An out-of-reach /
  no-target grab returns `null` from `computeThrow` ⇒ still whiff-like ⇒ no reset.) This reads the
  design's "reuses the union's **computed** outcomes" literally.
- **D4 — fire boundary: `ticksSinceOffense > limit`** (Q4). Increment each tick, then reset-on-
  contact, then check strictly-greater — so a fighter that connects on the `limit`-th contactless
  tick avoids the foul; the foul fires on the first tick the clock exceeds `limit` (the limit+1-th
  consecutive contactless tick).
- **D5 — any re-engage zeros both clocks** (Q5). Every `resetToNeutral(both)` this bout — yame OR
  jogai OR passivity — zeros **both** `ticksSinceOffense` (fresh engagement, swap-symmetric), gated
  on `match?.passivity`. A scored-on fighter reset by yame does not carry a stale count.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- **AC-1 — far-apart stall fires.** Given `match.passivity.limit = L` and two bots that never
  connect (idle, or move without reaching), Then on the first tick a clock exceeds `L` (post-
  increment) `resetToNeutral(both)` fires and both clocks zero. (Frame at the firing tick shows the
  pre-reset positions; both are back at `startX` from the next tick — the A1/jogai frame precedent.)
- **AC-2 — contact resets, attacker-only.** Given a bot whose strike connects (hit/block/parry) on
  tick T, Then its clock zeros at T and it needs `L+1` further contactless ticks to foul; the
  opponent it merely hit / that merely defended does NOT reset (its clock keeps climbing).
- **AC-3 — whiff-at-air does NOT reset** (the discriminator). Given a bot spamming an attack into
  empty air (out of range ⇒ `aOutcome === null`) or a grab with no target, Then it still fouls at
  `> L` — the whiff didn't reset. Proves "contact ≠ committing an attack".
- **AC-4 — stuffed/clash throw resets** (D3). Given a thrower whose live grab (`aThrow !== null`) is
  stuffed by an opposing strike or clashes with an opposing grab, Then its clock zeros that tick
  despite the voided grab.
- **AC-5 — unconditional increment** (D2). Given a fighter mid-committed-move or knocked-down that
  never connects, Then its clock advances each of those ticks (no state gate).
- **AC-6 — re-engage zeroing** (D5). Given a yame OR jogai OR passivity reset fires with passivity
  configured, Then both clocks zero. (Absent `match.passivity`, the field is never touched.)
- **AC-7 — at most one reset/tick, order, swap-symmetry.** The passivity block runs AFTER yame and
  jogai; if either already reset this tick, passivity does NOT also reset (single
  `resetToNeutral(both)` per tick). Both-passive same tick ⇒ one reset. Replay is swap-symmetric.
- **AC-8 — byte-identical absent, stable present.** Absent `match.passivity` ⇒ byte-identical to
  pre-B1 (field never framed). Present ⇒ replay-stable + swap-symmetric.
- **AC-9 — no new surface.** B1 adds NO `FIELD_READER` (perception is B3/B4) and NO `endReason`
  (a passivity reset re-engages; no penalty/winGap until B2). `dsl.ts` TCB untouched.

**Implementation notes (not user-facing):** a 3rd officiating block after jogai, gated
`if (match?.passivity)`. Per-tick (design §7a order): the clock increment + contact-reset sit in the
"update clocks" step (with jogai edge-detect); the exceed-check + `resetToNeutral(both)` + zeroing
sit in officiating AFTER the yame + jogai blocks, fired post-`events.push` (A1 frame precedent). A
`resetThisTick` flag (or equivalent) coordinates the "at most one reset" contract and lets the yame/
jogai reset sites also zero the clocks (gated). Contact-reset reads `aThrow` (not `aThrowFinal`).
`limit` lives in test fixtures — no canonical wiring in B1.

## B2 — resolved decisions & acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-02)

Confirmed before planning B2 (passivity feeds the shared penalty ladder). Feeds `planning`
directly. **B2 scope:** turn B1's inert passivity re-engage into a real penalty on the **shared**
`Fighter.penaltyCount` ladder (A2's) — NO new perception (B3/B4), NO new `endReason`.
Byte-identical absent `match.passivity`.

**Config/state:** unchanged from B1 — `FightConfig.match.passivity.limit` + per-fighter
`Fighter.ticksSinceOffense`. B2 adds NO new config or state; it reuses A2's bout-persistent
`Fighter.penaltyCount` (shared with jogai).

**Resolved decisions (find-gaps):**

- **D1 — per-fighter fouler, mutual net-zero** (Q1). When the passivity block fires, EACH fighter
  whose OWN clock `> limit` is a fouler: `++penaltyCount`, and past the free warning (`> 1`) its
  OPPONENT scores +1 — the identical per-fighter award as jogai (A2). Both idle ⇒ both clocks
  exceed the same tick ⇒ mutual +1 (net-zero gap), a SINGLE `resetToNeutral(both)`. Swap-symmetric,
  consistent with jogai's both-out AC-5.
- **D2 — fire independently of a same-tick score** (Q2). B1's fire condition is UNCHANGED
  (`ticksSinceOffense > limit`, no `scored` gate). A pure-defender that never commits an offense
  (attacker-only, B1 D1) fouls even while being hit — so on a tick where a hit-point rose but yame
  did NOT reset, the hit-point AND the passivity penalty both apply. ONLY yame's actual reset
  (both-neutral) pre-empts passivity, via the D5 clock-zeroing — exactly as it pre-empts jogai.
- **D3 — shared helper extracted now** (Q3). A2's inline award graduates to one shared
  `applyPenalty(fouler, opponent)` (the ladder rule "1 free, then opponent +1"), called from BOTH
  the jogai and passivity blocks. Pure extraction at the REFACTOR step (mutation confirms both call
  sites first); jogai stays byte-identical.
- **D4 — reuse `endReason "gap"`, re-check in block** (Q4). The passivity block gains the same
  winGap re-check jogai has, AFTER the award: if the gap reaches `winGap`, end the bout,
  `endReason "gap"`, winner = leader. NO new `endReason`. Mutually exclusive per tick with
  yame/jogai (each reset zeroes clocks / snaps in-bounds ⇒ at most one reset AND at most one winGap
  check per tick).

**Cross-mechanic interaction (the headline — structurally guaranteed, an AC below):** jogai and
passivity share ONE `penaltyCount`. Because at most one reset fires per tick (yame > jogai >
passivity, each zeroing the clocks), a jogai foul and a passivity foul NEVER co-occur on the same
tick — the interaction is SEQUENTIAL across ticks: a fighter that spent its free warning on a jogai
retreat pays a point on its FIRST subsequent passivity foul (and vice-versa).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- **AC-1 — free first passivity foul.** Given `match.passivity.limit = L` and a fighter's clock on
  its 1st `> L` fire of the bout (no prior foul of EITHER kind), When it fires, Then that fighter's
  `penaltyCount` = 1, NEITHER fighter's `points` change (warning only), and both reset.
- **AC-2 — 2nd+ passivity foul scores the opponent.** Given a fighter fouling passivity a 2nd (or
  later) time (its `penaltyCount` already ≥ 1 from any source), When its clock fires, Then its
  OPPONENT gains +1 point (visible in the NEXT tick's frame — awarded post-`events.push`, the
  A1/A2 precedent) and both reset.
- **AC-3 — shared free warning across mechanics.** Given a fighter already used its one free warning
  on a jogai foul (`penaltyCount` = 1), When its FIRST passivity foul fires, Then its opponent
  immediately scores +1 (no second free warning). Symmetric: passivity-first then a jogai foul also
  costs.
- **AC-4 — passivity penalty can end the match.** Given a passivity +1 makes the gap reach `winGap`,
  Then the fight ends that tick, `endReason "gap"`, winner = the leader. (winGap re-checked inside
  the passivity block after the award; at most one winGap check per tick.)
- **AC-5 — both-passive same tick, swap-symmetric.** Given both clocks exceed `L` on the same tick,
  Then each fighter's OWN prior foul count decides whether ITS opponent scores (both past the free
  warning ⇒ mutual +1, net-zero gap; one still on its free warning ⇒ only the other opponent
  scores), with a SINGLE reset and no spurious early-stop. Swap-symmetric.
- **AC-6 — attacker-only + fire-independent** (from B1 D1 + D2). Given a pure-defender turtle that
  only blocks/parries and never commits an offense, When its clock reaches `> L` even on a tick it
  is being hit (a point rose but yame did not reset), Then it still fouls (opponent +1 past the free
  warning) that tick — the hit-point and the passivity penalty both apply.
- **AC-7 — yame pre-empts passivity.** Given a scored + both-neutral tick where a clock also sits
  `> L`, Then the yame block resets first and (D5) zeroes both clocks, so the passivity check reads
  0 and does NOT fire ⇒ no passivity penalty, single reset. Same when a jogai reset fires the same
  tick.
- **AC-8 — byte-identical absent, stable present.** Given `match.passivity` absent, Then replay is
  byte-identical to pre-B2 (`penaltyCount` still only moved by jogai; no passivity award path
  touched). Given `match.passivity` present, replay is stable and swap-symmetric.
- **AC-9 — jogai unchanged by the extraction.** Given the shared-helper refactor, Then jogai's
  observable behavior (A2's AC-1…AC-7) is byte-identical — the helper is a pure extraction of the
  existing two-line award.

**Implementation notes (not user-facing):** award in the passivity block, per-fighter, gated on each
fighter's own `ticksSinceOffense > limit`; call the extracted `applyPenalty(fouler, opponent)` from
both jogai and passivity. winGap re-check + `break "gap"` after the award, before the
`resetToNeutral(both)`. Ladder constants (1 free, +1/foul) stay hardcoded/shared. `limit` stays
test-fixture-only (no canonical wiring — that's D). No new `FIELD_READER`, no new `endReason`,
`dsl.ts` TCB untouched.

## B3 — resolved decisions & acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-02)

Confirmed before planning B3 (self passivity clock read, live). Feeds `planning` directly.
**B3 scope:** the self-perception field **`self.passivityRemaining`** — Capability B's FIRST new
DSL surface. NO opponent read (that's B4), NO new `endReason`, NO canonical wiring (that's D). Also
**completes B1's throw-term behavioral verification** (AC-4), now that the clock is observable.
Byte-identical absent `match.passivity` (sentinel `0`).

**Config/state:** unchanged from B1/B2 — reuses per-fighter `Fighter.ticksSinceOffense` +
`FightConfig.match.passivity.limit`. B3 adds one `FieldPath`, one `SelfState.passivityRemaining`
field, one static `FIELD_READERS` entry, and threads `match` into `viewFor` (see notes).

**Resolved decisions (find-gaps):**

- **D1 — derived countdown value** (Q1). `self.passivityRemaining = Math.max(0, limit −
self.ticksSinceOffense)` when `match.passivity` is configured. A countdown of ticks until the
  passivity foul: reads `limit` on a fresh clock, decrements each contactless tick, and reads `0` on
  the tick the foul is imminent ("connect THIS tick or foul"). Mirrors the
  `finishWindow`/`counterWindow`/`cancelWindow` "ticks-left, 0 = closed" precedent. **Read timing:**
  `viewFor` runs at the loop top, BEFORE the tick's clock increment/foul-check, so the value reflects
  the clock as of the end of the previous tick (the same live-but-one-step convention as the other
  self windows). The `[0]` floor is defensive — the officiating resets the clock the tick it exceeds
  `limit`, so the read value structurally stays in `[0, limit]` (never negative).
- **D2 — sentinel `0` when unconfigured** (Q1, baked into the value choice). Absent `match.passivity`,
  `self.passivityRemaining` reads `0` — consistent with A3's `self.penalties` and every window field
  (the interpreter/TCB boundary can't depend on `match`; ONLY the derived value is config-gated in
  `viewFor`). Accepts the same in-band/inactive `0` collision the window fields already carry (a bot
  reading `0` while unconfigured over-eagerly commits, but there is no foul ⇒ harmless; a
  spec-authored bot knows the field reads `0` when passivity is off).
- **D3 — B3 completes B1's throw-term verification** (Q2). B1's `aThrow !== null` contact-reset term
  (a stuffed/clashed grab still zeroes the clock — B1 D3 / AC-4) had NO direct test: B1 could not
  observe the clock, so the `aThrow → false` mutant was survived-or-equivalent under B1's throw-free
  tests. Now that `self.passivityRemaining` makes the clock observable, B3 adds a `runFight` test
  reading it immediately after a committed throw's grab-active tick (including stuffed/clash) and
  asserting the snap-back to `limit` — pinning the term behaviorally (AC-3 below).
- **D4 — mechanical spec only; strategic prose deferred to Capability D** (Q3). Regenerate
  `docs/spec.md` so `self.passivityRemaining` joins the read-surface list + JSON-schema enum (drift
  test green), exactly like A3. Engagement-timing prose lands in D's spec-teaching slice with the
  rest of the officiating rules (A3's defer-prose-to-D pattern — avoids doc churn when D rewrites
  that section).

**Implementation notes (not user-facing):** thread `match` (the scoring config) into `viewFor` as a
new optional param — the smallest change, forward-compatible with later live officiating reads
(senshu/OT in Capability C); absent ⇒ sentinel `0`, derived like `finishWindow` inside `viewFor`.
`self.passivityRemaining` is a static `FIELD_READERS` entry `(s) => s.self.passivityRemaining` + a
`SelfState.passivityRemaining` field + a `FieldPath` union member — **no new interpreter branch**, so
the `dsl.ts` interpreter stays 100% (A3 precedent; only the value is config-gated, in `viewFor`).
`limit` stays test-fixture-only (no canonical wiring — that's D). AC-6's "just in time" test must
account for strike **startup lead**: the clock resets on a CONNECTING strike (`aOutcome !== null`),
which occurs on the strike's active frame, not the commit tick — so a bot must gate its commit at a
`passivityRemaining` threshold ≥ the move's startup for the strike to connect before the foul
(threshold derived in RED against the harness constants).

**Acceptance criteria:**

- **AC-1 — countdown when configured.** Given `match.passivity.limit = L` and a fighter that has not
  connected for `k` ticks (`k ≤ L`), Then its bot reads `self.passivityRemaining == L − k` (fresh
  clock ⇒ `L`; the tick the foul is imminent ⇒ `0`).
- **AC-2 — resets with the clock.** Given a fighter connects (or is re-engaged by yame/jogai/
  passivity), Then `self.passivityRemaining` jumps back to `L` on the next tick (the clock zeroed).
- **AC-3 — throw resets (completes B1 AC-4).** Given a fighter commits a throw whose grab goes active
  — even stuffed by an opposing strike or clashed (⇒ the grab is voided) — Then
  `self.passivityRemaining` snaps back to `L` the next tick, proving `aThrow !== null` zeroed the
  clock (the B1 throw term, now observable).
- **AC-4 — floored at 0, stays in `[0, L]`.** `self.passivityRemaining` never reads negative.
- **AC-5 — sentinel `0` unconfigured.** Given `match.passivity` absent, Then `self.passivityRemaining`
  reads `0` for the whole bout (the value is never derived).
- **AC-6 — the read is actionable.** Given a bot in range that gates a connecting commit on the
  countdown (`when self.passivityRemaining <= T do attack`, `T` = the startup lead), Then it connects
  before its clock fouls and avoids a passivity foul that the same bot without the rule (idling)
  takes — demonstrating the B3 value (self-timed forced engagement).
- **AC-7 — byte-identical absent, interpreter 100%, spec drift-clean.** Given `match.passivity`
  absent, replay is byte-identical to pre-B3 (sentinel `0`; `ticksSinceOffense` still never framed).
  The new `FIELD_READERS` entry is static (value config-gated in `viewFor`) ⇒ `dsl.ts` interpreter
  stays 100%. `docs/spec.md` regenerated (field joins the read-surface list + schema enum; byte-match
  drift test green). Replay-stable + swap-symmetric present.

## B4 — resolved decisions & acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-02)

Confirmed before planning B4 (opponent passivity clock read, delayed). Feeds `planning` directly.
**B4 scope:** the opponent-perception field **`opponent.passivityRemaining`** — how close the FOE is
to a passivity foul, on the **`L_act`-delayed** ring-buffer layer (like `opponent.stamina`/`gassed`,
C10 S4). **Completes Capability B.** NO new `endReason`, NO canonical wiring (that's D), NO change to
the officiating/penalty logic (pure-additive perception). Byte-identical absent `match.passivity`
(sentinel `0`).

**Config/state:** unchanged from B1–B3 — reuses per-fighter `Fighter.ticksSinceOffense` +
`FightConfig.match.passivity.limit`. B4 adds one `Frame.ticksSinceOffense` field, one
`OpponentState.passivityRemaining` field, one `FieldPath` member, one static `FIELD_READERS` entry,
and threads `match` into `perceiveOpponent` (see notes).

**Resolved decisions (find-gaps):**

- **D1 — DELAYED on the `L_act` layer** (Q1). `opponent.passivityRemaining` rides the coherent delayed
  action snapshot (`oppAct`), like `opponent.stamina`/`opponent.gassed`/`attacking` — **NOT** a live
  scoreboard read. Rationale: the _pending_ internal timer is a body-condition tell a bot must WORK to
  read (that latency IS B4's value — bait the forced commit, prep a counter); the _result_ (the landed
  foul) is ALREADY live via A3's `opponent.penalties`. The two are complementary — `penalties` = LIVE
  (result), `passivityRemaining` = DELAYED (pending). A live read would collapse the read-game.
- **D2 — raw `ticksSinceOffense` in the Frame, derive the countdown on serve** (Q2). `frameOf` records
  raw `f.ticksSinceOffense` (as it records raw `stamina`), staying scoring-config-agnostic (never
  touches `match`). `perceiveOpponent` derives `passivityRemaining = match?.passivity ? Math.max(0,
limit − oppAct.ticksSinceOffense) : 0`, threading `match` in as a new param (mirrors C10 S4b threading
  `rules` for `isGassedAt`). Observably identical to framing the pre-derived countdown, since `limit` is
  a constant: `delayed(max(0, limit − tso)) == max(0, limit − delayed(tso))` — the exact
  derive-on-serve equivalence that let `gassed` avoid its own frame field.
- **D3 — value coherent with B3's self read** (from D1+D2). The countdown equals B3's
  `self.passivityRemaining` formula (`max(0, limit − ticksSinceOffense)`) evaluated on the DELAYED
  clock. Because `frameOf` records at loop-top BEFORE the tick's passivity increment (`sim.ts:953`,
  same pre-increment convention as B3's `viewFor`), at **`L_act = 0`** the read equals the opponent's
  own `self.passivityRemaining` that tick (live coherence). The opening `lAct` ticks clamp to
  `history[0]` (`ticksSinceOffense = 0` ⇒ reads `limit`, a fresh clock). A re-engage/connect that
  zeroes the clock is perceived `lAct`-delayed (the drop-back-to-`limit` lands `lAct` ticks later).
- **D4 — sentinel `0` unconfigured; interpreter stays 100%; mechanical spec only** (A3/B3 precedent).
  Absent `match.passivity`, `perceiveOpponent` serves `0` (the value is never derived) — same
  in-band/inactive `0` collision B3 and every window field carry (harmless: no foul when unconfigured).
  `opponent.passivityRemaining` is a static `FIELD_READERS` entry `(s) => s.opponent.passivityRemaining`
  - an `OpponentState` field + a `FieldPath` member — **no new interpreter branch** ⇒ `dsl.ts`
    interpreter stays 100% (only the served value is config-gated, in `perceiveOpponent`). Regenerate
    `docs/spec.md` (field joins the read-surface list + JSON-schema enum; drift test green); strategic
    prose deferred to Capability D (A3/B3's defer-prose-to-D pattern).

**Jitter / observe-after-commit (automatic — no new machinery):** the field reads the same `oppAct`
frame as `attacking`/`stamina`, so the per-tick jittered `lAct` (drawn in the fixed A.lPos/A.lAct/
B.lPos/B.lAct order — the replay contract) applies with ZERO new draws. Perceivable iff
`S ≥ L_act + 1` at `L_act = 0` (the structural observe-after-commit tick), like every other L_act tell.

**Implementation notes (not user-facing):** add `ticksSinceOffense: f.ticksSinceOffense` to `frameOf`
(unconditional — the field is always present on the Fighter, init 0, only incremented under
`match?.passivity`, so absent config it frames `0` forever ⇒ byte-identical; the ring buffer is
internal, never in `FightResult`); add `passivityRemaining` to `perceiveOpponent`'s `Omit<OpponentState,
"points" | "penalties">` return, derived from `oppAct.ticksSinceOffense` + the new `match` param; pass
`match` at both `perceiveOpponent` call sites (`sim.ts:963/971`). Static `FIELD_READERS` + `FieldPath` +
`OpponentState` additions. `limit` stays test-fixture-only (no canonical wiring — that's D). No new
`endReason`, no officiating/penalty change, `dsl.ts` TCB interpreter untouched. (Observed via the B3
precedent — gate a distinctive action on `opponent.passivityRemaining` crossing a constant, assert via
`events[T].{a,b}.action`; use a FIXED `perception.lAct` with jitter off for the delay/coherence ACs.)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- **AC-1 — delayed countdown.** Given `match.passivity.limit = L`, a fixed `L_act = d > 0` (jitter off),
  and a foe idle since the bout start, Then at tick `t` (`t ≥ d`, no reset in the window) a bot reads
  `opponent.passivityRemaining == L − (t − d)` — the foe's countdown as of `d` ticks ago (the delayed
  layer), i.e. `d` HIGHER than the foe's live remaining (less elapsed ⇒ more remaining).
- **AC-2 — live coherence at `L_act = 0`.** Given `L_act = 0`, Then `opponent.passivityRemaining` equals
  the foe's own `self.passivityRemaining` that tick (the delayed frame resolves to the current frame).
- **AC-3 — re-engage snap-back is delayed.** Given the foe connects/re-engages (its clock zeroes) at
  tick T with `L_act = d`, Then the perceiving bot sees `opponent.passivityRemaining` jump back toward
  `L` at tick `T + d`, not at T (the drop is perceived `lAct`-delayed).
- **AC-4 — sentinel `0` unconfigured.** Given `match.passivity` absent, Then `opponent.passivityRemaining`
  reads `0` for the whole bout (never derived).
- **AC-5 — the read is actionable (bait the commit).** Given a bot that gates a counter-prep action on
  `opponent.passivityRemaining <= T` (the foe near its forced commit), Then it perceives the foe's
  imminent-foul window on the delayed layer and acts on it — demonstrating B4's value.
- **AC-6 — byte-identical absent, interpreter 100%, spec drift-clean.** Given `match.passivity` absent,
  replay is byte-identical to pre-B4 (the new `Frame.ticksSinceOffense` frames `0`, never enters
  `FightResult`; the served value is sentinel `0`). The new `FIELD_READERS` entry is static ⇒ `dsl.ts`
  interpreter stays 100%. `docs/spec.md` regenerated (field joins the read-surface list + schema enum;
  drift test green). Replay-stable + swap-symmetric present.

## C1 — resolved decisions & acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-02)

Confirmed before planning C1 (senshu first-blood tiebreak). Feeds `planning` directly. **C1 is
WKF-faithful** — deliberately refined beyond DESIGN.md §7a's "score ANY point / never lost" (see the
reconciliation action; §7a updated to match). NO overtime (C2), NO perception (C3 — `self`/
`opponent.senshu`), so the `dsl.ts` TCB stays untouched (no `FIELD_READERS` entry, interpreter stays
100%).

**Config:** `FightConfig.match.senshu?: boolean` — scoring-layer, NOT `Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES`
(`npm run fight` unaffected). Absent or `false` ⇒ no senshu tie-break ⇒ byte-identical. Test-fixture-
only until Capability D (the benchmark `MATCH` + spec prose adopt it there).

**State (no new per-fighter field):** a bout-level `senshuHolder: "undecided" | "A" | "B" | "none"`
local to `runFight` (like `endReason`), NOT on the `Fighter` body ⇒ `resetToNeutral` can't touch it
⇒ persists across every yame/jogai/passivity reset automatically. First blood is detected from the
**per-tick scored-technique points delta** (snapshot points at tick-top, read right after combat
resolution, BEFORE the jogai/passivity penalty block) — so penalty points never register as first
blood, with NO separate technique counter.

**State machine (one-way, deterministic):**

- start `undecided`.
- **Latch** (combat phase, only while `undecided`): the fighter whose technique points rose this tick
  claims senshu; both rose the same tick ⇒ `none` (simultaneous); neither ⇒ stays `undecided`.
- **Revoke** (penalty phase, only while holder is `A`/`B`): if the **holder** commits any jogai/
  passivity foul this tick (incl. the free 1st warning) ⇒ `none`. A foul by the non-holder does nothing.
- `none` is terminal — never re-latched, never transferred.

**Resolution order:** senshu is consulted ONLY at the terminal tally (post-loop) and ONLY when
`winner === "draw"` (level points). It never overrides a `winGap`/`"gap"` early-stop or a points-
decided `"time"` winner (both non-level ⇒ mutually exclusive with senshu). `FightResult.endReason`
gains the union member `"senshu"`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- **AC-1 — first-blood latch (solo).** Given `match.senshu` true and A lands the bout's first scored
  technique (1-0) at tick T, Then A holds senshu.
- **AC-2 — simultaneous ⇒ none (permanent).** Given both score a technique on the same first-scoring
  tick (1-1), Then senshu is `none` for the bout; a level cap stays winner `"draw"`, endReason
  `"time"`; a later solo technique does NOT claim it.
- **AC-3 — decides a level bout only.** Given A holds senshu and the bout is level at the cap (e.g.
  4-4), Then A wins, endReason `"senshu"`. Given NOT level (e.g. 5-3), Then the leader wins, endReason
  `"time"` (senshu never overrides a points winner).
- **AC-4 — gap early-stop unaffected.** Given the gap reaches `winGap`, Then endReason `"gap"`,
  winner = the leader, regardless of senshu (a `"gap"` bout is never level).
- **AC-5 — no-senshu draw.** Given a level cap with no holder (0-0, or `none`), Then winner `"draw"`,
  endReason `"time"` (unchanged from pre-C1).
- **AC-6 — penalty never confers.** Given a jogai/passivity penalty gives B its first point (never a
  technique), Then B does not hold senshu; a subsequent first A technique latches senshu to A.
- **AC-7 — holder's foul revokes.** Given A holds senshu and A later commits any jogai/passivity foul
  (incl. the free warning), Then senshu → `none` (not transferred to B); a level cap is then `"draw"`/
  `"time"`. (A non-holder foul leaves senshu intact.)
- **AC-8 — same-tick latch-then-revoke.** Given A scores its first technique AND fouls on the same
  tick, Then latch (combat phase) precedes revoke (penalty phase) ⇒ `none`.
- **AC-9 — persists across resets.** Given A holds senshu and yame/jogai/passivity resets occur, Then
  A still holds senshu at the cap.
- **AC-10 — byte-identical absent + swap-symmetric.** Given `match.senshu` absent/`false`, replay is
  byte-identical to pre-C1 (no `senshuHolder` consulted, no `"senshu"` endReason). Given present,
  replay is stable and swap-symmetric (holder A↔B mirrors under a fighter swap).

**Spec:** NO `docs/spec.md` change in C1 — `generateSpec`'s `Match` type is `{ winGap }` and emits no
`endReason`; the "equal ⇒ draw" win-condition prose stays accurate while `match.senshu` is fixture-
only. The prose fix (equal ⇒ senshu-holder, else draw) + the `Match` extension land in Capability D
alongside the benchmark `MATCH`/`INPUT_HASH`/`BENCHMARK_VERSION` adoption.

**DESIGN.md reconciliation (DONE this pass):** §7a's senshu row + the `match` config block were
updated to the confirmed semantics — "score ANY point" → **scored techniques only** (penalty points
never confer); "never lost" → **lost on the holder's Category-2 foul** (any foul, incl. free warning;
permanent; not transferred); standalone `match.senshu?: boolean`.

**Recommended slicing (for `planning`):** two PR-sized slices — **C1a** the latch (techniques-only) +
level-at-cap resolution + `endReason "senshu"` + `match.senshu` toggle (senshu-only fixtures; the
"fully independent bargain" tracer; byte-identical absent); **C1b** the revocation coupling — a
holder's jogai/passivity foul cancels senshu (co-configured jogai/passivity fixtures). Each byte-
identical-absent + replay-stable + swap-symmetric, with scoped mutation on the changed `sim.ts`
officiating regions.

## C2 — resolved decisions (grill 2026-07-02)

Confirmed before find-gaps/planning C2 (sudden-death overtime). Feeds `find-gaps` → `planning`
directly. **WKF encho-sen-faithful.** Extends the same `FightConfig.match` scoring-layer seam and
**folds in C4** (the `clock.overtime` live perception). NOT in `Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES`
(`npm run fight` unaffected). Absent `match.overtime` ⇒ byte-identical.

**Config:** nested `FightConfig.match.overtime?: { ticks: number }` (mirrors `jogai?: { margin }` /
`passivity?: { limit }`). Absent ⇒ no OT ⇒ byte-identical; `ticks: 0` ⇒ `cap` unchanged ⇒ no OT (falls
straight to the fallback). Test-fixture-only until Capability D.

**Trigger (Model X — OT-first, senshu-fallback):** on a bout that is LEVEL at the regulation cap
(`a.points === b.points` at the end of the last regulation tick, evaluated AFTER that tick's
officiating blocks), extend the single `runFight` loop by `overtime.ticks`. A senshu holder does NOT
short-circuit OT — OT runs on ANY level bout; senshu decides only if OT exhausts level (WKF
encho-sen-era authentic, and reuses C1's terminal senshu override UNTOUCHED — it just runs after the
extended loop, no reordering). Loop bound: `maxTicks + (level ? overtime.ticks : 0)`.

**OT entry:** `resetToNeutral` both fighters (fresh _encho-sen_ "yoi" — bodies/posture/guard/windows/
clocks reset; points, stamina, penaltyCount, mem, `senshuHolder` PERSIST); clear the `scored` yame
flag.

**Win condition (sudden death):** during OT the winGap threshold is effectively `1`
(`gap = inOT ? 1 : match.winGap`), applied at the EXISTING yame/jogai/passivity check-sites (no new
check-site). First fighter to a gap ≥ 1 wins at the next boundary → `endReason "overtime"`. A same-tick
mutual trade (both +1) ⇒ gap 0 ⇒ OT continues. Penalties are FULLY LIVE in OT — a 2nd+ jogai/passivity
foul's +1 is gap-1 ⇒ decides OT (`"overtime"`).

**Fallback cascade & `endReason`:** `endReason` gains only the union member `"overtime"`. Decider-named
terminal cascade on a level bout at the cap: gap-1 during OT → `"overtime"`; OT exhausts still level +
senshu holder → `"senshu"` (the existing terminal override, now after OT); OT exhausts still level + no
senshu → `"time"` (winner `"draw"`, unchanged); OT unconfigured → senshu/`"time"` as C1. NO `"draw"`
endReason value. `FightResult.ticks` counts executed ticks INCLUDING OT (gap-in-OT ⇒ `tick+1`;
OT-exhausted ⇒ `maxTicks + overtime.ticks`).

**Perception (C4 folded in):** `ClockState` gains `overtime: number` (view-only ⇒ NO `FightResult` byte
change ⇒ outcome replay still byte-identical absent OT). New DSL FIELD_READER `clock.overtime` (live
1/0, zero-delay public match fact like `opponent.points` — NOT the ring buffer; config-gated value ⇒
`dsl.ts` interpreter stays 100%). During OT `clock.ticksRemaining` counts down the OT budget
(`effectiveCap − tick`, never negative); absent OT config ⇒ `inOT` never true ⇒ `overtime` reads `0`
and `ticksRemaining` is unchanged (`maxTicks − tick`).

**Invariants:** integer-only outcome math (ticks/points/gap); the seeded PRNG threads OT unchanged;
same pre-tick snapshot per OT tick; `clock.overtime` is the story's ONLY new TCB surface (one static
reader, no host/net/fs/time/randomness). Byte-identical + replay-stable + swap-symmetric when
`match.overtime` absent.

**Recommended slicing (for `planning`):** two PR-sized slices — **C2a** the officiating (level-at-cap
OT entry + `resetToNeutral` + gap-1 sudden death + penalties-live + the fallback cascade + `endReason
"overtime"` + `ticks` accounting; overtime-only + co-configured senshu fixtures; byte-identical absent)
→ **C2b** the perception fold-in (`ClockState.overtime` + the `clock.overtime` reader + OT-budget
`ticksRemaining`; DSL-read + drift-clean fixtures). Each byte-identical-absent + replay-stable +
swap-symmetric, with scoped mutation on the changed `sim.ts` officiating regions (+ the `dsl.ts` reader
region for C2b).

**find-gaps resolutions (2026-07-02):** (1) a degenerate `overtime.ticks <= 0` leaves the loop cap
unchanged ⇒ no OT ⇒ byte-identical — NO validation (`match` is trusted engine config, like
`jogai.margin` / `passivity.limit`, neither validated). (2) A senshu HOLDER's OT foul (incl. the free
1st warning) revokes senshu, forfeiting the OT-exhausted fallback — KEPT (pure C1-revocation × Q4-
penalties-live composition; WKF-faithful; zero extra code — the revocation block already runs in the
continued loop). (3) C2b's `clock.overtime` reader forces a MECHANICAL `docs/spec.md` regen (the field-
whitelist bullet + JSON Schema enum gain `clock.overtime`, bare, like `clock.tick`) — the OT semantic
prose stays deferred to Capability D. **OT-entry timing mirrors yame:** the `resetToNeutral` fires at
the end of the last regulation tick's body (after its frame push, so that frame shows final regulation
positions), and `clock.overtime` flips `1` on the NEXT tick = the first OT tick (no extra boundary
frame). "Level at cap" = `a.points === b.points` evaluated after that tick's officiating blocks; a
mid-exchange combo at the cap is truncated by OT entry exactly as the regulation cap already truncates.

**Acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-02):**

- **AC-1 — OT entry on level.** Given `match.overtime.ticks = K > 0` and a bout LEVEL at the regulation
  cap, Then the fight runs additional ticks (both bodies `resetToNeutral` at entry — fresh neutral
  start; points, stamina, penaltyCount, mem, `senshuHolder` PERSIST) and does not decide on regulation
  points alone.
- **AC-2 — not level ⇒ no OT.** Given a NON-level bout at the cap (a leader by `1 ≤ gap < winGap`),
  Then no OT ticks execute; the leader wins, `endReason "time"`, `ticks = maxTicks` (byte-identical to
  the no-OT path).
- **AC-3 — sudden death, solo score wins.** Given OT in progress and A lands a scored technique (B does
  not the same tick), Then at the resolving yame boundary `|a−b| ≥ 1` ⇒ A wins, `endReason "overtime"`,
  `ticks = tick + 1`.
- **AC-4 — mutual trade stays level.** Given OT in progress and both score on the same tick (mutual
  +1), Then `|a−b| = 0` ⇒ OT continues (no win); the yame reset re-engages.
- **AC-5 — 0-0 scoreless regulation ⇒ OT decides.** Given a bout 0-0 through all of regulation
  (`senshuHolder` `undecided`), level at the cap, OT configured, and A scores first in OT, Then A wins,
  `endReason "overtime"` (the OT score also latches senshu to A, but the gap decides ⇒ moot).
- **AC-6 — penalty decides OT.** Given OT in progress and a fighter commits its 2nd+ jogai/passivity
  foul (opponent +1), Then `|a−b| ≥ 1` at the jogai/passivity check-site ⇒ the opponent wins,
  `endReason "overtime"`.
- **AC-7 — OT exhausts ⇒ senshu fallback.** Given OT elapses all `K` ticks still level and a senshu
  holder exists, Then the holder wins, `endReason "senshu"`, `ticks = maxTicks + K`.
- **AC-8 — OT exhausts ⇒ draw.** Given OT elapses still level with NO senshu holder (0-0 / `none`, or
  `match.senshu` unconfigured), Then winner `"draw"`, `endReason "time"`, `ticks = maxTicks + K`.
- **AC-9 — holder's OT foul forfeits senshu.** Given A holds senshu entering OT and A commits any
  jogai/passivity foul during OT (incl. the free 1st warning), Then senshu → `none`; if OT then
  exhausts level, winner `"draw"`, `endReason "time"` (A does NOT win the fallback). A NON-holder's OT
  foul leaves senshu intact.
- **AC-10 — winGap in regulation unaffected.** Given the gap reaches `winGap` during regulation, Then
  `endReason "gap"`, the leader wins, and no OT ticks execute (a `"gap"` bout is never level).
- **AC-11 — degenerate overtime.ticks.** Given `match.overtime.ticks ≤ 0`, Then the loop cap is
  unchanged ⇒ no OT ⇒ byte-identical to no-OT (`0` and absent are equivalent; no validation error).
- **AC-12 — clock.overtime perception.** Given OT configured, Then a bot reading `clock.overtime` in
  the DSL sees `0` on every regulation tick and `1` from the first OT tick onward (zero-delay public
  fact). Given `match.overtime` absent / `ticks ≤ 0`, Then `clock.overtime` reads `0` all bout.
- **AC-13 — ticksRemaining never negative.** Given OT in progress, Then `clock.ticksRemaining =
(maxTicks + K) − tick` (counts the OT budget down, ≥ 1 within OT): `1` on the last regulation tick,
  `K` on the first OT tick. Given `match.overtime` absent, Then `ticksRemaining = maxTicks − tick`
  (unchanged, byte-identical).
- **AC-14 — byte-identical absent + replay-stable + swap-symmetric.** Given `match.overtime` absent (or
  `ticks ≤ 0`), replay is byte-identical to pre-C2 (no extra ticks, `endReason` never `"overtime"`,
  `clock.overtime` always `0`, `FightResult` bytes unchanged). Given present, replay is stable and
  swap-symmetric (the OT winner A↔B mirrors under a fighter swap).
- **AC-15 — C2b spec drift-clean + interpreter 100%.** Given the `clock.overtime` reader is added, Then
  `docs/spec.md` is regenerated (the field-whitelist bullet + JSON Schema enum gain `clock.overtime`,
  bare — NO OT semantic prose, deferred to Capability D) and the drift test re-pins it byte-for-byte;
  the `dsl.ts` interpreter stays 100% (static reader, value config-gated).

**AC → slice map:** **C2a** (officiating) owns AC-1…AC-11 + AC-14; **C2b** (perception) owns AC-12,
AC-13, AC-15 + AC-14's perception half.

## C3 — resolved decisions (grill 2026-07-03)

Confirmed before find-gaps/planning C3 (senshu perception — the first-blood tells so a bot can
protect its own senshu or bait a holder into fouling it away). Feeds `find-gaps` → `planning`
directly. **Pure perception fold-in** — the C1 latch/revocation machinery already exists; C3 only
surfaces the bout-level `senshuHolder` to bots. Extends the same `FightConfig.match` scoring-layer
seam; NOT in `Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES` (`npm run fight` unaffected). Absent `match.senshu` ⇒
byte-identical.

**Read fields (Q1 — both):** `self.senshu` + `opponent.senshu`, bilateral like every other scoreboard
fact (`points`, `penalties`). _Protect_ reads `self.senshu` (don't foul my lead away); _steal_ reads
`opponent.senshu` — senshu never transfers, so "steal" = bait the holder into a Category-2 foul →
`none`. A one-sided tell would be the odd scoreboard fact out and can't drive the steal half.

**Perception layer (Q2 — live scoreboard, zero delay):** both ride the LIVE layer in `viewFor` off the
bout-level `senshuHolder` — NOT the `L_act` ring buffer — exactly like `opponent.points` /
`opponent.penalties`. Senshu is a public referee call derived from the _live_ per-tick point delta;
`opponent.points` is already zero-delay, so a delayed senshu would be incoherent (a bot could out-read
the delay from the live points it's computed from). Mechanically, `senshuHolder` isn't in the `Frame`
ring buffer at all — delaying would require inventing a per-fighter frame field for a semantically
wrong result.

**Encoding (Q3 — two booleans, collapse undecided+none):** egocentric `? 1 : 0`. For fighter A's view:
`self.senshu = senshuHolder === "A" ? 1 : 0`, `opponent.senshu = senshuHolder === "B" ? 1 : 0` (swap
for B). BOTH `undecided` (nobody yet) and `none` (simultaneous / revoked) collapse to `0/0` — a bot
can't distinguish "senshu still winnable" from "senshu gone forever." The strategically-distinct
"senshu still available" tell (undecided vs none) is DEFERRED as additive YAGNI (no gauntlet bot needs
it; a third `senshuOpen`-style read can be added later without breaking anything). `senshu` stored as a
`number` (0/1) on `SelfState`/`OpponentState` (the `gassed`/`points` convention), computed at the view
site so Stryker mutates the `===`/string-literals (killable) — sidesteps the C2b bare-`inOT ? 1 : 0`
`ConditionalExpression` under-generation gotcha.

**Threading:** `senshuHolder` (already a `runFight` local) is passed into `viewFor` at both call sites;
each site derives the two egocentric values (A-side `holder === "A"` / `holder === "B"`; B-side
mirrored) → swap-symmetric by construction. `viewFor` builds `self.senshu` / `opponent.senshu` into the
view; the two static `FIELD_READERS` (`(s) => s.self.senshu`, `(s) => s.opponent.senshu`) pass through
⇒ `dsl.ts` interpreter stays 100% (config-gated value only; the TCB boundary can't depend on `match`).

**Spec (Q5 — mechanical regen):** the two readers auto-propagate to `docs/spec.md` via `ALLOWED_FIELDS`
— the field-whitelist bullets + JSON Schema `fieldPath.enum` gain `self.senshu` / `opponent.senshu`,
bare (like `clock.overtime` in C2b). NO senshu win/draw semantic prose (deferred to Capability D). NO
`BENCHMARK_VERSION` / `INPUT_HASH` change (C3 touches no scoring input — that's Capability D). The
drift test re-pins the regenerated spec byte-for-byte.

**Invariants:** byte-identical when `match.senshu` absent (`senshuHolder` stays `undecided` ⇒ `0/0`,
and existing gauntlet bots don't reference the new fields ⇒ existing fights unchanged); replay-stable
(deterministic latch → pure view, no PRNG, integer-only); swap-symmetric (A's `self.senshu` ≡ B's
`opponent.senshu`); same pre-tick snapshot (senshu joins the live scoreboard group, never mixed into
the delayed ring-buffer snapshot — invariant #4 untouched). The two `FIELD_READERS` are the story's
ONLY new TCB surface (no host/net/fs/time/randomness).

**Recommended slicing (Q4 — one slice, for `planning`):** a SINGLE PR — `self.senshu` +
`opponent.senshu` share identical machinery (thread `senshuHolder` → `viewFor`, two readers, mechanical
spec regen); neither delivers standalone value and `self.senshu` alone can't be tested without the
threading `opponent.senshu` also needs. Mirrors C2b shipping two shared-machinery readers
(`clock.overtime` + OT-budget `ticksRemaining`) in one PR. Branch `feat/senshu-perception`.
Byte-identical-absent + replay-stable + swap-symmetric, with scoped mutation on the changed `viewFor`
region (`sim.ts`) + the reader region (`dsl.ts`) + the gen-spec drift test.

**find-gaps resolutions (2026-07-03):** (1) **AC-8 KEPT** — a dedicated `L_act > 0` fixture
behaviorally locks the Q2 "live layer" decision (`opponent.senshu` flips in lockstep with the live
`opponent.points`, NOT lagged `L_act` ticks), over relying on AC-7 + the unit reader row alone. (2)
**Proof depth** = a minimal probe bot that branches its move on `self.senshu` / `opponent.senshu` per
read (the C2b `clock.overtime` style) + interpret-tick reader-table rows; NO end-to-end protect/steal
strategy scenario (YAGNI — beyond any gauntlet bot). (3) **Read cadence:** senshu becomes visible on
the tick AFTER the latch/revoke — the SAME one-tick observe-after-commit cadence as the live
`opponent.points` (`viewFor` runs at the top of the tick, before combat/latch), NO additional
perception delay; a same-tick latch-then-revoke therefore never surfaces a transient `self.senshu = 1`
(AC-6). (4) `undecided` and `none` stay intentionally indistinguishable (both `0/0`) — the availability
nuance remains deferred.

**Acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-03):**

- **AC-1 — solo-holder read + swap.** Given `match.senshu` true and A latches senshu (a solo first
  technique) at tick T, Then from tick T+1 a bot reads A's `self.senshu = 1` / `opponent.senshu = 0`
  and B's `self.senshu = 0` / `opponent.senshu = 1` (swap-symmetric). Also verified as interpret-tick
  reader rows for both fields.
- **AC-2 — undecided read.** Given `match.senshu` true and no technique scored yet, Then both fighters
  read `self.senshu = 0` and `opponent.senshu = 0` (senshu still up for grabs, but indistinguishable
  from `none`).
- **AC-3 — none (simultaneous) collapses to 0/0.** Given both fighters score their first technique on
  the same tick (senshu → `none`), Then both read `self.senshu = 0` / `opponent.senshu = 0` for the
  rest of the bout — identical to undecided (the availability nuance is intentionally not exposed).
- **AC-4 — none (revoked) + revoke visibility.** Given A holds senshu (reads `self.senshu = 1`) then
  commits a jogai/passivity foul at tick T (senshu → `none`), Then from tick T+1 A reads
  `self.senshu = 0` and B reads `opponent.senshu = 0` — the hold is observably lost, not transferred
  (B's `self.senshu` stays `0`).
- **AC-5 — penalty never confers (visibility).** Given a jogai/passivity penalty gives B its first
  point (never a technique), Then no fighter ever reads B as holding senshu (B's `self.senshu` / A's
  `opponent.senshu` stay `0`); a subsequent solo A technique then makes A read `self.senshu = 1`.
- **AC-6 — same-tick latch-then-revoke never flashes.** Given A scores its first technique AND fouls on
  the same tick (C1 AC-8 ⇒ `none`), Then a bot NEVER reads `self.senshu = 1` for A on any tick — the
  view goes `0` (undecided) → `0` (none) with no transient hold (latch + revoke both resolve before the
  next view is built).
- **AC-7 — read cadence = live-points cadence.** Given senshu latches to A during tick T's combat, Then
  `self.senshu` first reads `1` on tick T+1's view — the SAME one-tick observe-after-commit cadence as
  the live `opponent.points` read (`viewFor` runs at the top of the tick), with NO additional
  `L_pos`/`L_act` delay (the senshu flip and the `opponent.points` increment surface on the same tick).
- **AC-8 — opponent.senshu is LIVE (immune to L_act).** Given `perception` with `L_act > 0` and A
  latches senshu at tick T, Then B reads `opponent.senshu = 1` on tick T+1 with NO `L_act` lag — in
  lockstep with B's live `opponent.points`, proving senshu rides the live scoreboard layer, not the
  delayed ring buffer.
- **AC-9 — persists across resets incl. OT.** Given A holds senshu and yame/jogai/passivity resets —
  and an overtime `resetToNeutral` — occur, Then A continues to read `self.senshu = 1` after each reset
  (`senshuHolder` persists; the read tracks it).
- **AC-10 — byte-identical absent + swap-symmetric + interpreter 100%.** Given `match.senshu` absent /
  `false`, Then both fields read `0` all bout, existing bots' fights are byte-identical (no
  `FightResult` change), and replay is stable; given present, the reads are swap-symmetric (A↔B mirror).
  The `dsl.ts` interpreter stays 100% (two static config-gated readers).
- **AC-11 — spec drift-clean.** Given the two readers are added, Then `docs/spec.md` is regenerated
  (field-whitelist bullets + JSON Schema `fieldPath.enum` gain `self.senshu` / `opponent.senshu`, bare
  — NO senshu win/draw prose, deferred to Capability D) and the drift test re-pins it byte-for-byte; NO
  `BENCHMARK_VERSION` / `INPUT_HASH` change (C3 touches no scoring input).

**AC → slice map:** a SINGLE slice (`feat/senshu-perception`) owns AC-1…AC-11 — both readers share the
`senshuHolder` → `viewFor` threading; no sub-split (Q4).

## Capability D — resolved decisions (grill 2026-07-03)

Confirmed before find-gaps/planning Capability D (downstream adoption — wiring the built §7
tie-resolution into the LLM benchmark and teaching it in `docs/spec.md`). **NO new engine behavior**
— every §7 mechanic (jogai/passivity/senshu/overtime) is already built + byte-identical-absent; D
flips a scoring-config flag and writes prose. Feeds `find-gaps` → `planning`.

**Scope (Q1 — tie-resolution only):** the benchmark adopts ONLY the tie-resolution mechanics;
**jogai/passivity are DEFERRED.** Rationale: jogai (ring-out) + passivity (non-engagement) change how
every gauntlet fight _plays_ (a wall-pinned zoner rung out; a turtle fouled), so the 6 archetypes —
authored/balanced under v3 (winGap only) — would need a FULL rebalance (the S6 sweeper de-wall, but
across two new mechanics at once), not a re-characterization. senshu/overtime carry no such risk:
they only rewrite level-at-cap bouts, never a _decided_ fight ⇒ purely additive to ranking
discrimination. jogai/passivity adoption belongs with the deferred `vulture` rebalance / air-actions
work, not "tie-resolution downstream adoption."

**Which tie param (Q2 — senshu only):** `MATCH = { winGap: 8, senshu: true }` — senshu only, NO
overtime. The v3 dogfood already showed ~1 draw / 120 fights; senshu resolves ~all of that tail at
ZERO cost (no extra ticks, no transcript/telemetry change, no `overtime.ticks` to justify). Overtime's
residual is marginal AND mostly unresolvable: the dominant leftover draw is `senshuHolder ===
"undecided"` (nobody opened a gap in 600 ticks — the both-defensive / mirror matchup), which by its
nature also fails to open a 1-gap in a sudden-death period ⇒ OT ends level ⇒ falls back to senshu ⇒
still `"undecided"` ⇒ STILL a draw. So OT would add ~2× tick budget on level bouts + a frozen `ticks`
value + re-characterization under a longer clock, to resolve only the rare `"none"` (simultaneous-
first) case. Not worth it. Overtime adoption deferred alongside jogai/passivity.

**Auto-propagation (confirmed in code):** D1 is a config flip + re-freeze, NOT a ranking-logic change.
The harness's `botWin`/`draw` key off `runFight`'s `winner` (`benchmark.ts:77-83`), which senshu
already REWRITES for a level bout (→ the holder). So flipping `senshu: true` in `MATCH` auto-
propagates: a level-at-cap benchmark bout resolves to a senshu winner in the `Submission` tally with
no aggregator change. The `net` tiebreak is INVARIANT under senshu — a senshu bout is level
(`scores.a === scores.b`) ⇒ `net = 0` ⇒ only win-rate moves. The only code change is widening the
harness `match` TYPE (`BenchmarkConfig["match"]`, currently `{ winGap }`) to the shared
`FightConfig["match"]` so `senshu` is carried typed.

**Spec scope (Q3 — senshu + corrected win/draw only):** the spec teaches ONLY senshu + the corrected
win/draw/tie cascade; **jogai/passivity/overtime prose DEFERRED** to their own (later) adoption.
Decisive principle = taught==scored: the spec IS the benchmark's measuring instrument
(`benchmarkSection` is parameterized by the frozen `MATCH`). Under `MATCH = { winGap, senshu }`, during
a benchmark fight `self.senshu`/`opponent.senshu` are LIVE, but `clock.overtime` and
`self`/`opponent.passivityRemaining` read sentinel `0` all match — teaching those semantics would point
authors at dead fields and contradict taught==scored. Those DSL fields already sit in the
auto-generated whitelist/JSON-schema as bare entries (config-gated, no prose) — consistent with how the
spec already carries gated fields. Concretely D2: correct `benchmarkSection`'s "equal ⇒ a draw" →
"level at cap ⇒ first-blood _senshu_ decides; still level (simultaneous first, or nobody scored) ⇒
draw," + a primer nudge making `self.senshu`/`opponent.senshu` actionable ("draw first blood to hold
the tiebreak").

**Re-characterization (Q5 — report-only, rides D1):** senshu is NOT cosmetic on the gauntlet — the v3
round-robin has material draws (`vulture` 29D, `sweeper` 13D, `zoner` 9D, `grappler` 8D per 100),
which senshu converts to decisive results and MOVES win-rates. And the dogfood's exact W/L/D record is
pinned as a characterization in `src/cli/dogfood.test.ts` ⇒ enabling senshu makes that test go RED
until re-pinned. So re-characterization is TEST-FORCED, part of D1's blast radius. Decision:
**report-only, NOT a balance gate** — adopt senshu because it's WKF-correct; re-pin `dogfood.test.ts` +
refresh the doc with the honest new numbers; DO NOT rebalance. If senshu pushes anyone further out of
`[25,75]`, that's DATA feeding the deferred `vulture` story, not a D1 blocker. D1's success =
"benchmark scores correctly under senshu + guard test green at v4 + characterization re-pinned," NOT
"5/6 in band." The dogfood re-pin + gauntlet-doc refresh both RIDE D1's PR (the dogfood test is
test-forced by the `MATCH` change; keeps committed docs from lagging the code). Doc handling REFINED by
find-gaps (AC-5): **ADD a new `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v4.md`, KEEP v3** (do NOT rename) — v3 is the
pinned record of the match-structure feature (cited by `.claude/CLAUDE.md`); renaming would destroy that
record + orphan two references.

**Version/hash (mechanical, D1 only):** D1 bumps `BENCHMARK_VERSION` v3→v4 + recomputes `INPUT_HASH`
(adding `senshu` to `MATCH` changes the digest; the guard test prints the new hash on drift) + updates
the guard test's version + `MATCH`-`toEqual` assertions. **D2 is VERSION-NEUTRAL** — it only reads
`MATCH` to generate prose, touches no scoring input ⇒ NO version/hash bump (the C3 precedent:
perception/spec fold-ins don't bump).

**Slicing & sequencing (Q4 — two slices, D1 → D2):** hard dependency — `generateSpec` defaults `match
= MATCH` (imported from `benchmark-config.ts`), so the spec can only teach senshu AFTER `MATCH` carries
it + v4 is frozen; spec-first would teach a tie-break the config doesn't enable (breaks taught==scored

- the drift test). Mirrors §7 S3 (adopt) → S5 (teach).

* **D1 — benchmark scores under senshu.** Widen harness `match` type → `FightConfig["match"]`; `MATCH =
{ winGap: 8, senshu: true }`; bump v3→v4 + recompute `INPUT_HASH` + update the guard test; re-pin
  `dogfood.test.ts`; ADD a new `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v4.md` (keep v3 — AC-5). **Observable:** a
  level-at-cap benchmark bout resolves to a senshu WINNER in the `Submission` tally (a draw becomes a
  win/loss).
* **D2 — spec teaches senshu.** Widen `generateSpec`'s `Match` type with `senshu?`; correct the
  win/draw prose + add the primer nudge; regenerate `docs/spec.md` (byte-drift test pins it).
  **Observable:** `docs/spec.md` explains the senshu win/draw cascade. Version-neutral.

**Invariants:** ENGINE untouched — the "byte-identical when `match` absent" invariant is about
`runFight` (senshu already honors it); D1 DELIBERATELY changes benchmark scoring (that's the point —
v3→v4 captures exactly this), guarded by the version bump. `npm run fight` unaffected (match is
benchmark-only, NOT in `Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES`). No TCB/DSL surface (no new `FIELD_READERS`; the
senshu readers shipped in C3). Determinism / integer-only / same-pre-tick-snapshot all untouched (no
engine change). D2 adds no ops (prose + type only). Scoped mutation: D1 on the changed
`benchmark-config.ts` + the guard test's forced values; D2 on the changed `gen-spec.ts` region + the
drift test.

**Still deferred beyond D:** overtime + jogai + passivity benchmark adoption (+ their spec prose), the
`vulture` parry→counter rebalance, then air-actions + the rest of §7 (rounds).

## Capability D — Acceptance criteria (find-gaps 2026-07-03)

AC→slice map at the end. All D1 unless tagged **[D2]**.

- **AC-1 — benchmark honors senshu (the mechanism).** Given a `benchmark()` run over a synthetic
  matchup that ends LEVEL at the tick cap with a SOLO first blood (one fighter's technique point rises
  first; neither reaches `winGap`), When `match = { winGap, senshu: true }`, Then that fight is tallied
  as a WIN for the first-blood holder in the `Submission` (`perOpponent` `wins` +1, `draws` +0); AND the
  SAME matchup under `match` senshu-absent tallies as a DRAW (`wins` +0, `draws` +1). Proven by a
  dedicated synthetic test in `benchmark.test.ts` on seed-independent `MOCK_RULES` — the mechanism proof,
  independent of the frozen gauntlet (which the dogfood re-pin, AC-4, covers).

- **AC-2 — `MATCH` / version / hash freeze (RED→bump→GREEN).** Given `MATCH = { winGap: 8, senshu:
true }` set while the manifest is still v3, Then (forced RED, right reason) `computeInputHash() !==
INPUT_HASH` (senshu entered the hashed `match` payload ⇒ the digest differs) AND the `MATCH` `toEqual`
  fails — proving the digest captured a REAL config change, not a gratuitous bump. When
  `BENCHMARK_VERSION` is bumped v3→v4 (new reason-label title: senshu tie-resolution adoption) and
  `INPUT_HASH` is re-pinned to the printed digest, Then (final GREEN) `benchmark-config.test.ts` is
  green: `MATCH` `toEqual({ winGap: 8, senshu: true })`, `BENCHMARK_VERSION` `toBe("v4")`,
  `computeInputHash() === INPUT_HASH`. The `MATCH`-`toEqual` shape assertion is the Stryker-killer for the
  `senshu` literal (an `ObjectLiteral`/`BooleanLiteral` mutant flips the freeze red).

- **AC-3 — net-tiebreak invariance (senshu moves only win-rate).** Given the AC-1 synthetic level-at-cap
  matchup, When `benchmark()` is run with `match.senshu` true vs senshu-absent (all else identical), Then
  `netPoints` is IDENTICAL across the two runs WHILE `wins`/`draws` diverge (the draw flips to a win).
  senshu never alters a tick — the per-fight `scores` are byte-identical; a level bout contributes `net
= 0` either way — so the Σ net-points tiebreak key is untouched; only win-rate moves (the grill's
  "purely additive to ranking discrimination"). [D1]

- **AC-4 — dogfood re-characterization (method + invariants; exact figures pinned at GREEN).** Given the
  v4 `MATCH` (senshu enabled), When the dogfood bot is re-run through the real `benchmark()` over the
  frozen gauntlet (6 opponents × 10 seeds × 2 sides = 120 fights), Then `src/cli/dogfood.test.ts` is
  re-pinned to the exact deterministic `wins`/`losses`/`draws`, subject to the invariants (verifiable
  independent of the numbers): `totalFights == 120`; `wins + losses + draws == 120`; **`draws ≤ 1`**
  (senshu only RESOLVES the prior lone draw — it never creates one; the draw stays only if its
  `senshuHolder` was `none`/`undecided`); the record is REPLAY-STABLE (identical across runs). The v3→v4
  test titles/comments are updated. The exact W/L/D is a GREEN-phase output, mirrored into
  `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v4.md` (AC-5). NO rebalance regardless of where the numbers land (report-only;
  any out-of-band shift feeds the deferred `vulture` story).

- **AC-5 — v4 gauntlet doc ADDED, v3 preserved (no rename).** Given the v4 re-characterization, Then a
  NEW `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v4.md` exists, titled for the senshu tie-resolution re-characterization,
  carrying the v4 round-robin (each member re-run under senshu) + the AC-4 dogfood record;
  `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v3.md` is left INTACT (the pinned record of the match-structure feature, still
  cited by `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). The D close-out ADDS a v4 pointer to CLAUDE.md/tracker (does NOT rewrite
  the v3 refs) ⇒ no dangling references. Report-only (no rebalance). _[find-gaps refinement of the grill's
  "rename → v4": a rename would destroy the v3 match-structure record CLAUDE.md cites + orphan two
  references.]_

- **AC-6 — corrected win/draw prose teaches the senshu cascade [D2].** Given the regenerated
  `docs/spec.md`, Then the benchmark-rules win-condition prose teaches the three-step cascade: a match
  ends early once a fighter leads by `winGap`; else at `maxTicks` it is decided on total points; if still
  LEVEL, the first fighter to have scored a technique point (SENSHU) wins; only a bout with NO first-blood
  holder (simultaneous first, or nobody scored) is a draw. A new `gen-spec.test.ts` assertion locks that
  the win-condition line names "senshu"; the existing assertion (the line contains "draw") STILL holds;
  both interpolated from `MATCH` (no hardcoded literal). Microcopy finalized at GREEN; the byte-drift test
  re-pins `docs/spec.md`. VERSION-NEUTRAL (D2 touches no scoring input ⇒ no `BENCHMARK_VERSION`/
  `INPUT_HASH` change).

- **AC-7 — primer senshu nudge, augmenting the "play the match" bullet [D2].** Given the regenerated
  `docs/spec.md`, Then the EXISTING "play the match, not the scoreboard" primer bullet is AUGMENTED with
  an actionable senshu clause — if the bout stays level, first blood holds the senshu tiebreak; read
  `self.senshu` / `opponent.senshu` (draw first blood / bait the holder). Observable: a primer line names
  "senshu" AND code-spans BOTH `self.senshu` and `opponent.senshu`; the existing "match win-rate" primer
  assertions (winGap + maxTicks, `gen-spec.test.ts:325-338`) STILL hold. Microcopy at GREEN; byte-drift
  re-pin. Version-neutral. _(A single augmented bullet, not a second "play the match" thread.)_

- **AC-8 — invariants (inherited vs deliberate).** The ENGINE is untouched (senshu shipped in C1/C3), so:
  (1) `runFight` "byte-identical when `match` absent" is INHERITED, not re-proven in D; (2) D1
  DELIBERATELY changes benchmark SCORING (v3→v4, guarded by the version bump) — NOT a byte-identical
  change; (3) the v4 benchmark stays DETERMINISTIC / REPLAY-STABLE (`benchmark()` is pure; same inputs →
  identical `Submission`), locked by the guard test + the dogfood characterization + the existing
  `benchmark.test.ts` determinism test; (4) SWAP-SYMMETRY is inherited (both sides A/B played; senshu is
  swap-consistent per C1); (5) `npm run fight` unaffected (match is benchmark-only, not in
  `Rules`/`CANONICAL_RULES`).

- **AC-9 — non-goals (explicitly out of scope for D).** (1) NO new DSL/TCB surface — the senshu readers
  shipped in C3; D adds no `FIELD_READERS` / no `ALLOWED_FIELDS` bullets; D2's `docs/spec.md` drift is
  BOUNDED to the win-condition prose (AC-6) + the one primer bullet (AC-7). (2) NO `endReason` surfacing —
  the benchmark ranks on `winner`, not `endReason`, and `endReason` isn't a DSL field; the spec needn't
  teach the literal `"senshu"` endReason. (3) NO rebalance (report-only; AC-4/AC-5). (4) NO
  jogai/passivity/overtime adoption or prose (deferred to their own later capability).

| AC-6 | **D2** | win-condition prose teaches winGap → senshu → residual-draw (`gen-spec.test.ts` + drift) |
| AC-7 | **D2** | primer "play the match" bullet augmented w/ senshu + `self`/`opponent.senshu` (drift)    |
| AC-8 | D1+D2  | inherited engine invariants + benchmark determinism/replay/swap                          |
| AC-9 | D1+D2  | non-goals (no DSL/TCB surface, no endReason, no rebalance, no jogai/passivity/OT)        |

## Next Step

**Capability A (jogai) COMPLETE** (A1+A2+A3, PRs #97–#99). **Capability B (passivity) COMPLETE**
(B1 clock #100, B2 shared penalty ladder #101, B3 self read #102, B4 opponent read #103). **Capability
C (tie resolution) COMPLETE** — C1 (senshu #104–#105) + C2 (overtime #107–#108) + C3 (senshu perception
#110); see Progress. `main`@`a9d9a38`. **C4 (`clock.overtime`) shipped inside C2b.**

**Capability D (benchmark + spec senshu adoption) COMPLETE** — D1 (benchmark scores under senshu, #113)
and D2 (spec teaches the senshu win/draw cascade, #114), merged 2026-07-03, `main`@`0b8c3f1`; see Progress.
**Scoped to senshu only** (`MATCH = { winGap: 8, senshu: true }`, `BENCHMARK_VERSION v4`, `INPUT_HASH`
re-pinned; `generateSpec` teaches the `winGap → senshu → residual-draw` cascade + the `self.senshu` /
`opponent.senshu` tells, gated on `match.senshu`). 872 tests; D1 mutation 100% (65/65), D2 100% (6/6). The
plan `d-benchmark-spec-adoption.md` is deleted (record in git / PRs #113–#114 + `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v4.md`).

**Next (the standing §7 remainder — all DEFERRED; each needs `grill-me` → `planning` → TDD):**

1. **Gauntlet rebalance** — the `vulture` parry→counter follow-up (16%, out the low `[25%,75%]` band; a
   naive offense buff backfired), now joined by a NEW D1 finding: **`sweeper` 82% (out-of-band HIGH under
   senshu)**. Both are report-only in `docs/benchmark-gauntlet-v4.md`; neither is rebalanced (D was
   adoption-only). A rebalance is a separate capability.
2. **Deferred jogai / passivity / overtime adoption** — D scoped to senshu only; folding jogai/passivity/OT
   into `MATCH` (+ `INPUT_HASH`/version) and teaching their prose in `generateSpec` was deliberately deferred
   (each would force its own gauntlet re-characterization / possible rebalance). The jogai + passivity
   MECHANICS are already built (Capability A / B); only their benchmark+spec adoption remains.
3. **Rest of §7** — **rounds** (the last unbuilt match-structure piece).
4. **Air-actions** — air strikes / horizontal jump displacement (a separate roadmap capability).

This standing tracker is KEPT (the §7 design record + resolved-decisions/AC sections below remain the
authoritative reference for the deferred adoption work).
