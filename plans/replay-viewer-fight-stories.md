# Replay viewer "make it fight" — child stories

Split via `story-splitting` (2026-07-18) from `plans/replay-viewer-fight-decisions.md`
(grilled + gap-tightened design). Feeds `planning` — one child story at a time → PR-sized
implementation slices → TDD. Harness-first order, honoring the grilled sequencing decision.

## Parent (reframed)

**A spectator watching a replay** (and the developer tuning the viewer) **sees two fighters
that read as _actually fighting_** — big and engaged at believable distances, with bending
limbs, strikes and grabs that land on contact, each wearing its authoring model's identity.

_Current constraint (why it's too large):_ today the figures are tiny and far apart (they hit
the air), limbs are rigid single segments (no elbows/knees), and heads are plain colored
circles. Four visual capabilities + one tuning tool — too big for one slice.

_Shape note:_ this is a **capability + quality** split (four largely-parallel visual
improvements + a harness), not a walking-skeleton-then-thicken shape. Each child is a distinct
user-visible capability; they compose rather than layer.

## Progress

- **Story 1 · `/dojo` pose lab — ✅ COMPLETE + ARCHIVED** (2026-07-18). 3 slices, PR-per-slice
  (#329 · #330 · #331); plan archived at `docs/archive/replay-viewer-fight-s1-dojo.md` (archive
  PR #332, `main` @ `9ecb5f5`). The tuning harness every later slice is demoed on is live.
- **Story 2 · model-identity heads — ✅ COMPLETE + ARCHIVED** (2026-07-18). 3 slices, PR-per-slice
  (#333 shared source · #334 glyph heads on `/watch` · #335 `/dojo` picker); plan archived at
  `docs/archive/replay-viewer-fight-s2-heads.md` (archive PR #336, `main` @ `eff2c36`). The "coin" (disc)
  was dropped mid-plan for a bare glyph head. Fighters now wear their author's mark on real replays.
- **Story 3 · big fighters (world-scale) — ✅ COMPLETE + ARCHIVED** (2026-07-18). 2 slices, PR-per-slice
  (#338 body world-scale from one height knob · #339 head glyph 0.3× body height); plan archived at
  `docs/archive/replay-viewer-fight-s3-scale.md` (archive PR #340, `main` @ `9db85a2`). Fighters now fill
  the ring at fighting distance; the head scales with the body from the one knob. **Straight limbs still.**
- **Story 4 · limbs bend (elbows & knees) — NEXT** (see the split-candidates table row 4). Needs
  `planning` to slice it; its plan file lands with Slice 1's PR (the established pattern — plan shipped in #338).
- Story 5 (strikes connect) not started.

## Recommended first slice

**`/dojo` pose lab** — the two-figure tuning harness. **✅ Done — see Progress above.**

_Why this was first:_ it burned down the integration/architecture risk (new dark route +
synthetic tape driving the **real** `scene()`/`createStage` pipeline) and became the demo +
tuning surface every later slice is built and signed off on. Its value was **developer /
learning**, not spectator — stated explicitly.

## Acceptance examples (per story — precondition → trigger → observable)

**1 · `/dojo` pose lab**

- Route loads → two fighters render on the dark canvas at the default state.
- Figure A posture set to CROUCH → A renders crouched (assert pure-model scene-graph joints).
- Gap slider snapped to "gyaku 240k" → the two roots sit 240k sub-units apart (assert projected x).
- action=strike + throwing + knockdown on one figure (impossible combo) → renders per `poseFor` precedence (PRONE) without error.

**2 · Coin heads**

- Fighter a model `"Claude Opus 4.8"` → a's head node `data-brand="claude"` (the claude coin).
- Model `"grok-2"` → brand `grok`, explicit mono treatment; empty/unknown → `generic`.
- Left-facing fighter → coin renders **upright** (counter-flip), not mirrored.
- Existing `BrandMark` / `ModelLogo` champion-card tests pass **unchanged**.

**3 · Big fighters**

- Contact-distance frame → the two fighters occupy a large fraction of ring width (assert projected extents).
- Height knob `H` → all dims scale proportionally (head diameter ≈ 0.3·H).
- Jump frame → lifts without NaN; extreme jumps may clip (accepted, M12).

**4 · Limbs bend**

- STAND → each arm shows `shoulder→elbow→hand` with the elbow off the straight line (assert offset).
- PRONE knockdown → body horizontal with its **authored** elbow/knee (assert 11 joints).
- Left vs right facing → elbows bow the correct way (assert bend flips with facing).
- Same frame scrubbed forward then back → identical joints (determinism).

**5 · Strikes connect**

- attacking, `attackReach` 240k, opponent near-edge in range → striking hand lands on the near edge.
- opponent beyond `attackReach` → limb extends to the cap and stops short (whiff reads as whiff).
- `throwing` → both grab hands reach the near edge using `throw.reach`.
- gap ≈ 0 / opponent behind facing → limb shows the forward floor (never backward).
- `attackReach` absent/negative on the wire → limb keeps its stance pose (defensive → 0).
- Engine change → replays remain **byte-identical** (additive render field).

## Dependencies

- **5 → 4 (hard):** the IK solve needs story 4's elbow joint.
- **5 → `attackReach` task (hard):** the reach data.
- **4 → 3, 3 → (none) (soft):** bends look better at scaled proportions, but aren't blocked; scale is independent-valuable with straight limbs.
- **2 → nothing (independent):** heads ship to real replays regardless of `/dojo`; the `/dojo` brand picker is a nicety added within story 2.
- All of 3/4/5 touch the shared pose/scale model → sequence **scale → bends → connect** to avoid churn, but each is independently testable through the pure model.

## Parking lot

- **`attackReach` = enabling task, owned by story 5.** Planning **may** land it as a standalone
  byte-identical prep PR first (the harness-first instinct from grilling) — but it is **not** an
  independent story (a hidden field with no behavior = component task).
- **Deferred follow-on arc** (post this split, decided later in `/dojo`): per-move signature
  silhouettes + chamber→snap→recover animation — needs `move` id + move-phase render fields.
- **`/dojo` control growth** stays within the story that needs it (brand picker → story 2).

## Warnings

- **Story 1's value is developer/learning, not spectator** — legitimate (harness/tool), but
  stated openly. Swap to heads-first if spectator value should lead.
- **Don't resurrect `attackReach` / "engine field" as its own story** — it's a component task;
  folded into story 5 (red flag avoided).
- **Stories 3/4/5 share the pose/scale model** — real churn risk if reordered; keep scale →
  bends → connect.

## Next step

Stories 1–3 (`/dojo` pose lab · model-identity heads · big fighters/world-scale) are done +
archived. **Story 4 — limbs bend (elbows & knees)** is next: **load `planning` for story 4** to
sequence it into PR-sized TDD slices. Shape (table row 4 + M4): grow the `Skeleton` to ~11 joints
(add `elbow L/R`, `knee L/R`); bones become `shoulder→elbow→hand` / `hip→knee→foot`; the mid-joints
are **derived** from endpoints + a facing-aware bend rule (elbows bow back, knees forward) for
STAND/CROUCH/AIR — no new authored constants; the strike/guard/throw override layers set the
**hand/foot endpoint** and the mid-joint **re-derives**; **PRONE authors all 11 joints** itself
(a downed body reshapes everything). Pure/scrub-safe — **no IK reach-to-target yet** (that's story 5,
which also lands the `attackReach` engine field). Each planned slice repeats the full cycle —
`tdd` · `testing` · `mutation-testing` (manual scan; `web/` is not Stryker-reachable) ·
`refactoring`, RED→GREEN→MUTATE→KILL→REFACTOR — before the next begins. **Keep 4 → 5 (bends →
connect) in order** — story 5 hard-depends on story 4's elbow joint + the `attackReach` task.
