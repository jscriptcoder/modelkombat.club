# Plan: C9 — Arsenal foundation (band-legality gate + first technique)

**Branch**: `feat/c9-band-legality-gate` (Slice 1) · `feat/c9-kizami-zuki-jab` (Slice 2)
**Status**: Active — **Slice 1 MERGED (PR #67)**; **Slice 2 code complete (pending commit
approval)** on `feat/c9-kizami-zuki-jab`. Slice 2 result: 421/421 green (byte-identical
prior suite + 7 new); `dsl.ts` allowlist mutation 100% (TCB); `sim.ts` changed-line 12/13
killed with **one documented equivalent** — the pre-existing `cancelInto ?? []`
ArrayDeclaration (`sim.ts:373`), unkillable since no valid `MoveId` equals the bogus
string. Mutation also surfaced a real gap (cancel-path unconfigured-move guard untested) →
added the cancel-target-unconfigured test. Docs reconciliation (BOT-DSL.md jab/kick/
roundhouse examples → Japanese roster; CLAUDE.md C9 Status entry) deferred to the split's
Slice 7 (C9 completion), not per-technique.

> Implements **Slice 1** of `plans/c9-arsenal-split.md` (the multi-move arsenal
> foundation), broken into two PR-sized planning slices. Session-resolved defaults:
> Japanese move ids; band-legality is a **runtime degrade-to-idle** gate (not a
> validator reject); `strike` stays as scaffolding (retired in the split's final slice).

## Goal

A bot can throw a band-restricted named technique (the jab `kizami-zuki`), and any
out-of-band `attack` degrades to `idle` — landing the multi-move schema (`MoveId` union,
record-keyed `Rules.moves`, `MoveSpec.bands`, the `dsl.ts` `MOVES` allowlist) and the
band-legality gate **additively**: byte-identical to today when unused.

## Acceptance Criteria (capability-level)

- [ ] An out-of-band `attack` (resolved `band ∉ move.bands`) starts **no** move — no
      startup, no stamina spend, no score — at **both** move-start sites, but the two
      _degrade differently_: a **neutral** commit (`sim.ts:370`) → `idle` (fighter stays
      neutral); an **on-contact cancel** (`sim.ts:357`) → the cancel is **not honoured**, so
      the fighter simply **continues its current move's recovery** (it is mid-move, not idle).
- [ ] A `MoveSpec` with **no** `bands` declared is legal at every band ⇒ `CANONICAL_RULES`
      (whose `strike` declares none) is **byte-identical**; the full suite stays green.
- [ ] `"kizami-zuki"` is a valid `MoveId`: the validator accepts `{type:"attack",
move:"kizami-zuki", band:…}`; an unknown move id is still **rejected** by the TCB allowlist.
- [ ] On a fixture, a `kizami-zuki` landed at a legal band (`high`/`mid`) in reach scores
      **1**; at `low` it fizzles to `idle`; beyond its (short) reach it **whiffs**.
- [ ] `dsl.ts` interpreter/validator region stays at **100%** mutation; `sim.ts`
      changed-line **100%** (project bar).

## Slices

Every slice follows RED-GREEN-MUTATE-KILL MUTANTS-REFACTOR. No production code without a
failing test. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (invariants #1–#4) + testing rules before coding.

### Slice 1: Out-of-band attacks fizzle (the band-legality gate)

**Value**: bot author — an attack a move can't perform at that height no longer commits;
height becomes a per-move constraint, the foundation the whole arsenal read-game rests on.
**Path**: bot returns `{type:"attack", move, band}` → `intake` checks `bandLegal(spec,
band)` before committing → illegal ⇒ condition fails ⇒ falls through to `idle` (no commit,
so `spend`/`startAttack` never run); legal ⇒ commits exactly as today. Same guard added to
the cancel-exception condition. Observability: a fizzle leaves `points` + `self.stamina` +
fighter state unchanged vs a legal commit. **Skipped state**: no telemetry emission on
fizzle (the telemetry object is NOT YET BUILT — a separate roadmap item).
**Schema**: add `MoveSpec.bands?: Band[]` — optional; **absent ⇒ all bands legal**
(byte-identical). No `MoveId`/allowlist change in this slice (proven against `strike`).
**`bands` semantics** (resolved): `bandLegal = spec.bands === undefined ||
spec.bands.includes(band)`. So **absent ⇒ unrestricted**; an **empty `[]` ⇒ every band
illegal ⇒ the move always fizzles** (the literal semantics — no special-case branch).
`bands` is trusted Rules data (not bot-validated), so a degenerate `[]` is an author
error the engine does not defend against.
**Required implementation skills**: load `tdd`, `testing`, `mutation-testing`,
`refactoring`, and `typescript-strict` (the `MoveSpec` contract change) before code.
**Acceptance criteria** (present + confirm before any code):

1. Fixture with `strike.bands = ["high","mid"]`: a neutral `attack` at `low` ⇒ fighter
   stays `neutral`, scores nothing, spends no stamina — while the same attack at `mid`
   commits + spends (the contrast pins the gate, not just "nothing happened").
2. A `MoveSpec` with no `bands` (canonical `strike`): `attack` at all three bands commits
   as before ⇒ byte-identical replay against a recorded baseline.
3. Edge: an attacking, in-window-cancelable fighter that cancels into a band the
   follow-up can't strike ⇒ the cancel is **ignored**, the fighter **continues its
   current move's recovery** (not idle), and crucially `cancelRemaining` is **not
   reset** — so a later _in-band_ cancel within the same window still fires.
4. A fizzle is a **pure no-op**: the fighter stays `neutral` (never enters `attacking`),
   so it raises no `attacking`/`attackBand` tell to the opponent, and — being
   uncommitted (neutral ∧ not guarding) — it **regens this tick exactly like idle**
   (the existing C10 rule; **no new code** for regen). _Covered transitively, no dedicated
   test:_ the gate adds zero regen code, a fizzle lands in the same `neutral ∧ not guarding`
   state the existing C10 regen suite already proves recovers, and AC-1 pins the
   no-spend/no-commit half (a pure low-fizzler starts at `max`, so a +`regen` rise is not
   directly observable without a contrived spend-then-fizzle sequence).
5. The gate is on the **`attack` action only**. `sweep` (band engine-fixed to `low`)
   and `throw` (unbanded) are **out of scope** — their height is engine-determined, so
   `bands` on `moves.sweep` is meaningless and not consulted.

**Notes / non-gaps** (recorded so they aren't re-litigated):

- _Verification vehicle_: byte-identical (AC-2 / capability AC) is proven by extending
  the existing replay/determinism test (`run-fight.test.ts`) with a no-`bands` fixture —
  not a new harness.
- _Check order_: `bandLegal` and `affordable` are both pure AND-conditions; order is
  immaterial to the outcome (either failing ⇒ no commit). A future telemetry layer may
  want to distinguish _why_ a commit failed (out-of-band vs gassed) — deferred with the
  telemetry object.
- _Resolved literal_: by `intake` time `action.band` is already a concrete `Band` (the
  DSL interpreter resolved any dynamic expression upstream), so `bandLegal` tests the
  resolved literal. "Runtime" gate means _authoring-time_ band dynamism, not deferred
  resolution.
  **RED**: the three tests above, via `runFight` on test fixtures (lowest level that gives
  confidence). Mutator-aware (`resources/mutator-rules.md`): the `spec.bands === undefined ⇒
true` branch (a mutant making absent⇒illegal must die), the `includes` membership boundary
  (band in/not-in the list), and the `&&` short-circuit added to the intake condition.
  **GREEN**: `const bandLegal = (spec: { bands?: Band[] }, band: Band) => spec.bands ===
undefined || spec.bands.includes(band);` — add `&& bandLegal(rules.moves[action.move],
action.band)` to the neutral-attack condition (`sim.ts:370`) and the cancel-exception
  condition (`sim.ts:361`).
  **MUTATE**: run `mutation-testing` (diff-against-main) on `sim.ts`.
  **KILL MUTANTS**: cover the absent-bands branch, both `includes` boundaries, and the
  short-circuit; ask the human if any survivor's value is ambiguous.
  **REFACTOR**: assess (likely none — one pure predicate + two guard clauses).
  **Done when**: all ACs met, byte-identical replay test green, suite + typecheck + lint
  green, mutation report reviewed, human approves commit.

### Slice 2: Bot can throw the jab (`kizami-zuki`)

**Value**: bot author — the first real technique with distinct trade-offs (short / fast /
cheap, `high·mid`, 1 yuko); the gate from Slice 1 now bites a real move on a realistic fixture.
**Path**: `MoveId` gains `"kizami-zuki"`; `Rules.moves` gains optional `"kizami-zuki"?:
MoveSpec`; the `dsl.ts` `MOVES` allowlist (the TCB security boundary for `attack.move`)
gains `"kizami-zuki"`; a fixture configures the jab spec. Observability: `runFight` awards
+1 on a legal in-reach jab. **`sim.ts` DOES change** (find-gaps 2026-06-29): once a move id
is OPTIONAL in `Rules.moves`, `rules.moves[action.move]` is `MoveSpec | undefined`, so the
two attack-handling sites (`intake` neutral commit + cancel exception) must capture the
spec once and guard `spec !== undefined` — an attack referencing an allowlisted-but-
**unconfigured** move degrades to **idle / inert** (like an unconfigured `sweep`/`throw`).
Byte-identical for configured moves (`strike` is always present ⇒ guard always true).
**Contract decision** (split parking-lot #2): explicit optional key `"kizami-zuki"?:
MoveSpec` (keep `strike` **required** through the additive phase; switch `Rules.moves` to
`Partial<Record<MoveId, MoveSpec>>` only at the split's final retirement slice).
**Required implementation skills**: load `tdd`, `testing`, `mutation-testing`,
`refactoring`, `typescript-strict` (the `MoveId` union + allowlist = a TCB change), and
`api-design` (the `MoveId` contract) before code.
**Acceptance criteria** (present + confirm before any code):

1. Validator accepts `{type:"attack", move:"kizami-zuki", band:"mid"}`; rejects an
   unknown id (e.g. `{move:"oroshi"}`) with the existing structured "unknown move" error.
   **Validator scope** (resolved, runtime-gate decision): it accepts any _syntactically_
   valid `move` (∈ allowlist) + `band` (∈ bands) pair — e.g. `{move:"kizami-zuki",
band:"low"}` **validates** — and the _runtime_ band-legality gate decides whether it
   connects or fizzles. No static out-of-band reject in this slice.
2. `runFight` on a fixture (a `kizami-zuki` spec with reach **<** `strike.reach`): a legal
   in-reach `kizami-zuki` at `mid` scores **1**; at `low` ⇒ `idle` (Slice-1 gate); at a gap
   **beyond jab reach but within `strike.reach`** ⇒ **whiff** (proves the shorter reach is
   real — position beyond the jab's reach; `strike` need not be in the fixture).
3. **Unconfigured ⇒ inert** (the find-gaps blocker): a bot attacking `kizami-zuki` against
   a `Rules` that configures only `strike` (no `kizami-zuki` key) ⇒ `idle` — no score, no
   spend. Pins the `spec !== undefined` guard (removing it would crash on `undefined`).
4. `CANONICAL_RULES` (no `kizami-zuki` key) unchanged ⇒ existing fights byte-identical;
   the jab is **not** wired into canonical until the split's Slice 7. The jab also gets
   **no `cancelInto`** here (cross-move cancels are the split's Slice 6).
   **RED**: validator tests (accept new id / reject unknown) + the four `runFight` behaviors
   (in-reach mid scores 1 · low fizzles · beyond-jab-reach whiffs · unconfigured fizzles).
   Mutator-aware: the `MOVES` set membership (a mutant dropping the new id must fail the
   accept test; a mutant adding a bogus id is caught by the reject test); the reach boundary
   (`<=` vs `<` at the jab-reach edge — borrow the existing strike-reach boundary test shape);
   and the **`spec !== undefined` guard** (a mutant forcing it true ⇒ `startAttack(undefined,…)`
   crash on the unconfigured-move test).
   **GREEN**: extend the `MoveId` type union; add `"kizami-zuki"` to the `MOVES` `Set`; add
   the optional `"kizami-zuki"?: MoveSpec` key to `Rules.moves`; **in `sim.ts`** capture
   `const spec = rules.moves[action.move]` once per attack-handling site and gate on
   `spec !== undefined` (a small restructure of the two `if` conditions — byte-identical for
   the always-present `strike`); add the fixture spec in the test.
   **MUTATE**: run `mutation-testing` on `dsl.ts` (the allowlist/validator) + `sim.ts`.
   **KILL MUTANTS**: the allowlist is TCB — every member's membership must be test-pinned
   (keep `dsl.ts` at 100%); kill the reach-boundary + `spec !== undefined` survivors.
   **REFACTOR**: assess (e.g. whether the test fixture deserves a shared `kizami-zuki` factory).
   **Done when**: all ACs met, suite + typecheck + lint green, mutation report reviewed,
   human approves commit.

## Pre-PR Quality Gate (each slice)

1. Mutation testing — `mutation-testing` skill (diff-against-main); meet the project bar.
2. Refactoring assessment — `refactoring` skill.
3. `npm run typecheck` + `npm run lint` pass.
4. Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` Status (a new C9 entry) and reconcile `docs/BOT-DSL.md`'s
   illustrative move-id examples with the Japanese roster — at the slice where it lands.

## Slice 2 parking lot — RESOLVED (find-gaps + recon 2026-06-29)

- ✓ **Unconfigured move ⇒ idle/inert** (the Blocker): `spec !== undefined` guard at both
  attack sites; allowlist still rejects unknown ids. → AC-3 + Path/GREEN above.
- ✓ **No exhaustive `MoveId` switch** to break: `dsl.ts` switches are on `e.op`/`e.type`,
  not move ids (re-grepped) — extending the union is safe. The only TCB touch-point is the
  `MOVES` allowlist (`dsl.ts:121`).
- ✓ `kizami-zuki` gets **no `cancelInto`** (cross-move cancels = split Slice 6). → AC-4.
- ✓ **Validator scope**: accepts any valid `move`+`band`; runtime gate decides legality
  (no static out-of-band reject). → AC-1.
- ✓ Jab frames / reach / `staminaCost` live in a **test fixture**, not `CANONICAL_RULES`
  (split parking-lot #3 — canonical re-tune is the split's Slice 7). → AC-2/AC-4.

## Gaps closed — find-gaps session 2026-06-29 (Slice 2)

Resolved (4):

- [Blocker → AC-3 + Path/GREEN] Unconfigured-but-allowlisted move ⇒ idle/inert (`spec !== undefined` guard; sim.ts changes)
- [Should → AC-1] Validator scope: accepts valid move+band; runtime gate decides legality (no static reject)
- [Should → AC-4] Jab has no `cancelInto` in this slice (cross-move cancels deferred to split Slice 6)
- [Should → recon] No exhaustive `MoveId` switch exists ⇒ union extension is safe; TCB = the `MOVES` allowlist only

Parked: none.

## Gaps closed — find-gaps session 2026-06-29 (Slice 1)

Resolved (9):

- [Blocker → schema note] `bands: []` ⇒ every band illegal (literal `undefined || includes`; no special-case)
- [Blocker → capability AC] Out-of-band degrades _differently_ per site: neutral ⇒ idle, cancel ⇒ continues recovery
- [Should → AC-4] Fizzle is a pure no-op that **regens like idle** (§P7 "idle"; effort lives in the whiff)
- [Should → AC-3] Ignored cancel does **not** reset `cancelRemaining` (window survives for a later in-band cancel)
- [Should → AC-4] Fizzle stays `neutral` ⇒ raises no `attacking`/`attackBand` tell
- [Should → note] Byte-identical verified via existing `run-fight.test.ts` replay, no new harness
- [Nice → AC-5] Gate is `attack`-only; `sweep`/`throw` out of scope
- [Nice → note] `bandLegal`/`affordable` order immaterial (telemetry-reason split deferred)
- [Nice → note] `action.band` is a resolved literal by intake ("runtime" = authoring-time dynamism)

Parked: none for Slice 1. (Slice 2 candidates in the parking lot above.)
